GLAF022FO,GLOBAL_StringTable.csv,Ford,"All the time, until I figured out that if you firestart them, they don't set off a cloud of confusion.",
GLAF023RA,GLOBAL_StringTable.csv,Raz,"In Lungfishopolis, I'm really big, but there are these tanks...",
GLAF024FO,GLOBAL_StringTable.csv,Ford,Do what any self-respecting monster would do!,
GLAF025FO,GLOBAL_StringTable.csv,Ford,Pick 'em up! Throw them at something! Boom!,
GLAF026FO,GLOBAL_StringTable.csv,Ford,"Ha! But if you're surrounded, don't forget your shield. And try to time it right.",
GLAF027RA,GLOBAL_StringTable.csv,Raz,"Airplanes can be a pain, can't they?",
GLAF028FO,GLOBAL_StringTable.csv,Ford,"Well you gotta shield until you see an opening, and then PSI Blast 'em out of the sky!",
GLAF029RA,GLOBAL_StringTable.csv,Raz,Were you watching those Electro Trucks?,
GLAF030FO,GLOBAL_StringTable.csv,Ford,"Yeah, RUN AWAY. That's my advice there. PSI Blast them from a distance, or run around the side of them and smack them with your monster claw.",
GLAF031RA,GLOBAL_StringTable.csv,Raz,What about a really big turret with shots you couldn't dodge?,
GLAF032FO,GLOBAL_StringTable.csv,Ford,"Shield! After your enemy takes a shot, advance. When you see them about to shoot again, shield up! Get real close that way, and you can take any shot you want.",
GLAF033RA,GLOBAL_StringTable.csv,Raz,Did you know that this camp has a bear problem? ,
GLAF034FO,GLOBAL_StringTable.csv,Ford,"Oh, not just any bears, but bears that have been mutated by Psitanium.",
GLAF035FO,GLOBAL_StringTable.csv,Ford,Now they know Telekinesis!,
GLAF036FO,GLOBAL_StringTable.csv,Ford,When you see that TK claw come out you have to dodge it quick.,
GLAF037FO,GLOBAL_StringTable.csv,Ford,"And PSI Blast those bears from a distance, or set their tails on fire.",
GLAF038RA,GLOBAL_StringTable.csv,Raz,What do you do when you hear a cougar?,
GLAF039FO,GLOBAL_StringTable.csv,Ford,"Go invisible quick. Those mutant PSI cougars can firestart at quite a distance, but they can't burn what they can't see.",
GLAF040FO,GLOBAL_StringTable.csv,Ford,"And also, if you pick them up with TK you can actually distract them for a little bit, and use that to your advantage.",
GLAF041RA,GLOBAL_StringTable.csv,Raz,What about those creepy guys who pull you under ground?,
GLAF042FO,GLOBAL_StringTable.csv,Ford,"Oh, be careful with people's nightmares, son.",
GLAF043FO,GLOBAL_StringTable.csv,Ford,They'll pull you into their nightmare world and never let go.,
GLAF044FO,GLOBAL_StringTable.csv,Ford,You gotta feed them some of their own medicine. ,
GLAF045FO,GLOBAL_StringTable.csv,Ford,Avoid their grab attacks and try to hurt them to the point that they split open.,
GLAF046FO,GLOBAL_StringTable.csv,Ford,And then grab any chunks of their victims that you can find--use TK to throw them into the gaping hole and that should choke up its system.,
GLAF047FO,GLOBAL_StringTable.csv,Ford,When it turns to glass you can shatter it with one good punch.,
GLAF048RA,GLOBAL_StringTable.csv,Raz,I've got these little thistle girls attacking me.,

GLAF054RA,GLOBAL_StringTable.csv,Raz,How would you kill a really big walking snail with a cannon?,
GLAF055FO,GLOBAL_StringTable.csv,Ford,"Well, remember you can tumble fast when you're using your mental focus...",
GLAF056FO,GLOBAL_StringTable.csv,Ford,That should help you avoid their cannonballs.,
GLAF057FO,GLOBAL_StringTable.csv,Ford,"And when you get up close, punch them, and when they're all sealed up like a pill bug...",
GLAF058FO,GLOBAL_StringTable.csv,Ford,Light the fuse on their head and see what happens when that cannon goes off inside their armor.,
GLAF059FO,GLOBAL_StringTable.csv,Ford,"And when you're tired of that, pick them up with TK and throw them in the water. Snails can't swim! Hee hee!",
GLAF060RA,GLOBAL_StringTable.csv,Raz,That Tiger wrestler's got a mean pounce.,
GLAF061FO,GLOBAL_StringTable.csv,Ford,"Yeah, but it's not so mean if you shield at the right moment.",
GLAF062FO,GLOBAL_StringTable.csv,Ford,And if you're invisible then he's just out of luck.,
GLAF063RA,GLOBAL_StringTable.csv,Raz,The Dragon wrestler has this roar that glues me to the floor.,
GLAF064FO,GLOBAL_StringTable.csv,Ford,"That's the thing. You gotta be off the floor when that happens. As soon as he starts to let out a roar, you jump as high as you can and PSI Float. Then he can't get you.",
GLAF065RA,GLOBAL_StringTable.csv,Raz,Two words: Ca-caw.,
GLAF066FO,GLOBAL_StringTable.csv,Ford,"Well, I mean. That's really one word isn't it?",
GLAF067RA,GLOBAL_StringTable.csv,Raz,How are you spelling it?,
GLAF068FO,GLOBAL_StringTable.csv,Ford,C-a-hyphen-c-a-w.,
GLAF069RA,GLOBAL_StringTable.csv,Raz,"Oh, well if you're going to use a hyphen, I mean--",
GLAF070FO,GLOBAL_StringTable.csv,Ford,"It's a hyphenated word. One, hyphenated word. Like, um, half-wit.",
GLAF071RA,GLOBAL_StringTable.csv,Raz,"Look, are you--",
GLAF072FO,GLOBAL_StringTable.csv,Ford,"Watch his shadow, and when you see him coming down, turn on your shield for a real back-breaking landing.",
GLAF073RA,GLOBAL_StringTable.csv,Raz,Back hyphen breaking. Two words.,
GLAF074RA,GLOBAL_StringTable.csv,Raz,That Cobra wrestler resists attacks.,
GLAF075FO,GLOBAL_StringTable.csv,Ford,"Yeah, that concentration yap he's giving don't mean a thing if you can hit him with a nice confusion grenade. While he's trying to remember his name, he's vulnerable.",
GLAF076RA,GLOBAL_StringTable.csv,Raz,How do I kill that armless guy with the swords in his mouth?,
GLAF077FO,GLOBAL_StringTable.csv,Ford,Ah youth. I remember the first time I asked that very question.,
GLAF078FO,GLOBAL_StringTable.csv,Ford,You can't kill something like that. But you might be able to use his weapons to your own advantage.,
GLAF079FO,GLOBAL_StringTable.csv,Ford,"Once his swords go into the wall, I'll bet you could swing on them in that way you do so well.",
GLAF080RA,GLOBAL_StringTable.csv,Raz,Hellish bunnies spewed forth from meat grinders? Ring a bell?,
GLAF081FO,GLOBAL_StringTable.csv,Ford,"At this point, I just say beat the heck out of em. Something like that shouldn't even exist!",
GLAF082RA,GLOBAL_StringTable.csv,Raz,You've been very helpful. That's all I need.,
GLAF083FO,GLOBAL_StringTable.csv,Ford,Good luck!,

GLAG012FO,GLOBAL_StringTable.csv,Ford,Your enemies can't kill what they can't see.,
GLAG013FO,GLOBAL_StringTable.csv,Ford,Have you considered setting fire to everything?,
GLAG014FO,GLOBAL_StringTable.csv,Ford,"Keeping your target locked will enable you to focus your powers better, and perform better evasive maneuvers!",
GLAG015FO,GLOBAL_StringTable.csv,Ford,Why fight someone when you can confuse them from a distance and let them fight themselves?,
GLAH000FO,GLOBAL_StringTable.csv,Ford,Hope that makes you feel pretty.,
GLAI000FO,GLOBAL_StringTable.csv,Ford,"Well, if you're up for some experimental training, you should go see Sasha in his lab, under the GPC. Should be marked on your map.",
GLAI001FO,GLOBAL_StringTable.csv,Ford,Looks like you need some better firepower. Better come see me in my lab for your Marksmanship Merit Badge.,
GLAI002FO,GLOBAL_StringTable.csv,Ford,Go take Sasha's marksmanship training! Why else did I give you that learner's permit?,
GLAI003FO,GLOBAL_StringTable.csv,Ford,"Well, now that your mind is a deadly weapon, why not go teach that garbage-spitter a lesson.",
GLAI004FO,GLOBAL_StringTable.csv,Ford,The one in your vision. Not Sasha.,
GLAI005FO,GLOBAL_StringTable.csv,Ford,Well it is about time you got some Levitation instruction.,
GLAI006FO,GLOBAL_StringTable.csv,Ford,Go take a canoe out to see Agent Vodello. She's teaching class right now.,
GLAI007FO,GLOBAL_StringTable.csv,Ford,I'm a little worried about your foil-headed friend. Now he's not alone!,
GLAI008RA,GLOBAL_StringTable.csv,Raz,What do  you mean?,
GLAI009FO,GLOBAL_StringTable.csv,Ford,"I mean more and more kids are acting just like him. Sitting inside on such a nice day, watching TV up in the lodge.",
GLAI010FO,GLOBAL_StringTable.csv,Ford,I'm afraid something very wrong is going on.,
GLAI011FO,GLOBAL_StringTable.csv,Ford,"Better get back to that vision you had in the Brain Tumbler, and use your Levitation to get a closer look.",
GLAI012FO,GLOBAL_StringTable.csv,Ford,Why are you just standing here when you should be running down to the lake to make sure your girlfriend isn't being kidnapped by the monster that lives in the water?,
GLAI013RA,GLOBAL_StringTable.csv,Raz,"Hey, we are just good friends.",
GLAI014FO,GLOBAL_StringTable.csv,Ford,"Oh, well. That changes everything. Just let her get eaten then.",
GLAI015FO,GLOBAL_StringTable.csv,Ford,Get to the end of the docks and get in that bathysphere quick! Before that fish gets away!,
GLAJ000FO,GLOBAL_StringTable.csv,Ford,Dodge that garbage it's spitting out!,
GLAJ001FO,GLOBAL_StringTable.csv,Ford,"And when it's sucking it back up, bust open one of those nail boxes and see how it likes the taste of those!",
GLAJ002FO,GLOBAL_StringTable.csv,Ford,Take that little door you found in Sasha's lab and use it on the monster.,
GLAJ003FO,GLOBAL_StringTable.csv,Ford,We have to get in it's head if we're going to find out where it took the girl!,
GLAJ004FO,GLOBAL_StringTable.csv,Ford,We have to get back to the other side of the lake. That's where Oleander took the girl.,
GLAJ005FO,GLOBAL_StringTable.csv,Ford,"We're by the old, abandoned insane asylum. I'll bet Oleander has his headquarters up inside.",
GLAJ006FO,GLOBAL_StringTable.csv,Ford,And keep your eyes peeled for stolen brains.,
GLAJ007FO,GLOBAL_StringTable.csv,Ford,The thief might have dropped some along the way.,

GLAJ010FO,GLOBAL_StringTable.csv,Ford,Let's find a way into that asylum!,
GLAJ011FO,GLOBAL_StringTable.csv,Ford,We have to get by that creepy guard and take the elevator upstairs.,
GLAJ012FO,GLOBAL_StringTable.csv,Ford,I'll bet that's where Oleander has the girl.,
GLAJ013FO,GLOBAL_StringTable.csv,Ford,Maybe you could make some kind of a disguise...,
GLAJ014FO,GLOBAL_StringTable.csv,Ford,"What are we doing down here? We need to be up in the tower, trying to free your girlfriend!",
GLAJ015FO,GLOBAL_StringTable.csv,Ford,Try to shoot those rats before they get too close!,

GLAJ017FO,GLOBAL_StringTable.csv,Ford,"Oh, watch out for that guard crow.",
GLAJ018FO,GLOBAL_StringTable.csv,Ford,I'll bet he might not be too alert if you smacked him with a confusion grenade.,
GLAJ019FO,GLOBAL_StringTable.csv,Ford,Just steer clear of the nutbag in the shower cap.,

GLAJ024FO,GLOBAL_StringTable.csv,Ford,Let's give this turtle back to that sad girl with the oven mitts on.,
GLAJ025FO,GLOBAL_StringTable.csv,Ford,Use Telekinesis to put that little turtle's brain in that tank's cockpit!,

GLAK002FO,GLOBAL_StringTable.csv,Ford,"You gotta find all those leaks that are squirting out censors, and take 'em out!",

GLAK004FO,GLOBAL_StringTable.csv,Ford,Those little censors seem to be restoring the big guy's health. ,
GLAK005FO,GLOBAL_StringTable.csv,Ford,You gotta shut down the leaks the little censors are coming out of!,
GLAK006FO,GLOBAL_StringTable.csv,Ford,Take the big guy out! ,
GLAK007FO,GLOBAL_StringTable.csv,Ford,Don't forget to hold mental focus while you're blasting!,
GLAK008FO,GLOBAL_StringTable.csv,Ford,Locking focus on him will also make it easier to circle around and get behind him!,
GLAL000FO,GLOBAL_StringTable.csv,Ford,"Do whatever Milla says, young man. You're in her classroom now.",
GLAL001FO,GLOBAL_StringTable.csv,Ford,"Stay on your bubble, Raz.",

GLAM002FO,GLOBAL_StringTable.csv,Ford,Keep after that bunny!,
GLAM003FO,GLOBAL_StringTable.csv,Ford,Watch out for those killer plants. You can't hurt them when they're all coiled up.,
GLAM004FO,GLOBAL_StringTable.csv,Ford,"Stay on the ground if you want to fight, but you could probably avoid some of it if you took the higher route. ",
GLAM005FO,GLOBAL_StringTable.csv,Ford,We gotta get up to the top of that vine tower!,
GLAM006FO,GLOBAL_StringTable.csv,Ford,You can hide behind those pillars to break his target-locking on you.,
GLAM007FO,GLOBAL_StringTable.csv,Ford,"Wait until he rears up to charge, and then blast him in his soft pink underbelly! Ha!",
GLAM008FO,GLOBAL_StringTable.csv,Ford,"And then when he's upside down, get him!",
GLAM009FO,GLOBAL_StringTable.csv,Ford,"Get as high as you can, and float in shooting!",

GLAN003RA,GLOBAL_StringTable.csv,Raz,Diabolical!,
GLAN004FO,GLOBAL_StringTable.csv,Ford,It's probably the enormous communications tower on that distant island.,
GLAN005FO,GLOBAL_StringTable.csv,Ford,Smash your way through town and take down that tower.,
GLAN006FO,GLOBAL_StringTable.csv,Ford,"Your PSI Shield would protect you in that tunnel, and maybe even do some damage to the emitters.",

GLAO000FO,GLOBAL_StringTable.csv,Ford,Open the fridge! Like he said!,
GLAO001FO,GLOBAL_StringTable.csv,Ford,Use your Clairvoyance power on that loony. I'd like to see what color the sky is in his world.,

GLAO003FO,GLOBAL_StringTable.csv,Ford,That is the worst road crew disguise I have ever seen.,

GLAO005FO,GLOBAL_StringTable.csv,Ford,Hmmm. Looks like we'll need some flowers as a disguise.,
GLAO006FO,GLOBAL_StringTable.csv,Ford,To the Arboretum!,
GLAO007RA,GLOBAL_StringTable.csv,Raz,The what?,
GLAO008FO,GLOBAL_StringTable.csv,Ford,"The plant place. It's like a garden, but more shrubby and scientific.",
GLAO009FO,GLOBAL_StringTable.csv,Ford,Let's search this place for flowers.,
GLAO010FO,GLOBAL_StringTable.csv,Ford,"If you used Clairvoyance on the that crow feather, you might get a birds-eye view of the situation.",
GLAO011FO,GLOBAL_StringTable.csv,Ford,You could probably burn those big vines off that mausoleum.,
GLAO012FO,GLOBAL_StringTable.csv,Ford,Let's get inside that mausoleum!,
GLAO013FO,GLOBAL_StringTable.csv,Ford,We have to find a way through the sewers to the Book Depository.,

GLAO019FO,GLOBAL_StringTable.csv,Ford,Use your Clairvoyance on one of those helicopters and we'll be able to search for the Milkman from the air.,
GLAO020FO,GLOBAL_StringTable.csv,Ford,That telephone would be a good disguise for getting up to those phone company wires.,
GLAO021FO,GLOBAL_StringTable.csv,Ford,Ever play doorbell ditch?,

GLAO024FO,GLOBAL_StringTable.csv,Ford,You can't see in the dark but she can!,
GLAO025FO,GLOBAL_StringTable.csv,Ford,Clairvoyance will let you see what she sees!,
GLAO026FO,GLOBAL_StringTable.csv,Ford,Shoot those exploding cookie boxes.,

GLAP010FO,GLOBAL_StringTable.csv,Ford,Let's take that prop magic cloud elevator thing up to the catwalks.,
GLAP011FO,GLOBAL_StringTable.csv,Ford,Those spotlights couldn't find you if you were invisible.,

GLAQ010FO,GLOBAL_StringTable.csv,Ford,We gotta get some fancy food for that fat guy to eat.,

GLAQ013FO,GLOBAL_StringTable.csv,Ford,Why don't you TK a pail on top of em? That will slow 'em down.,
GLAQ014FO,GLOBAL_StringTable.csv,Ford,We're going to have to infiltrate the grounds of the stronghold and see if we can't get the drawbridge down for fatty. ,
GLAR000FO,GLOBAL_StringTable.csv,Ford,"Buy all the paintings you can, and look for hooks to hang them on.",
GLAR001FO,GLOBAL_StringTable.csv,Ford,And for crying out loud STAY OFF THE STREET.,
