WWAD012FR,WW_StringTable.csv,Fred,"Hey, you take that little victory if you need it, tiny man. ",

WWAJ003RA,WW_StringTable.csv,Raz,Want me to call a doctor?,
WWAJ004KN,WW_StringTable.csv,Knight,"No, I'm not sick. I just can't find any decent food around here. An army moves on its stomach, you know. An elite force such as I require an elite cuisine, I'm afraid.",

WWAO002SN,WW_StringTable.csv,Snails,"If it is truly a time of war then we are ready. We can no longer pull our heads into our shells and hide.

WWBC003SN,WW_StringTable.csv,Snails,Yeah! Us too! Victory!,
WWAM005P2,WW_StringTable.csv,Peasant-2,I just hope she doesn't spend it all on scrapbook-making supplies. She's gone nuts about that stuff. Part of the reason I'm so ready to die. ,

WWAD003FR,WW_StringTable.csv,Fred,Shut up!,

WWBF014NP,WW_StringTable.csv,Napoleon,I am not short but you should know for future reference that small people do not enjoy being lifted up as if they were children. I am an Emperor! I am King!,
WWBF015FR,WW_StringTable.csv,Fred,Hee hee hee!,
WWBF016NP,WW_StringTable.csv,Napoleon,"Oh, ohhhhh...",
WWBF017NP,WW_StringTable.csv,Napoleon,"Wait... what IS the purpose of war? Maybe diplomacy could, uh",
WWBF018NP,WW_StringTable.csv,Napoleon,"Ah! Wait, who said that?",
WWBG000CN,WW_StringTable.csv,Carpenter,You can't fool me by giving me money! I know you're a burglar!,
WWBG001CN,WW_StringTable.csv,Carpenter,How about the burglar on my roof? Does he care about that?,
WWBG002CN,WW_StringTable.csv,Carpenter,Ah! A gun! And I was just starting to believe that you weren't a burglar!,
WWBH000CN,WW_StringTable.csv,Carpenter,"I only care about wood, and nails, and bridges.",
WWBH001CN,WW_StringTable.csv,Carpenter,"Ow! Hey, whose side are you on?",
WWBH002CN,WW_StringTable.csv,Carpenter,Oooh... ohhh...,
WWBI000P1,WW_StringTable.csv,Peasant-1,"I'm not in this for the money. If our leaders cared about us, I'd fight for nothing!",
WWBI001P1,WW_StringTable.csv,Peasant-1,"Oh, I got a gun already. But who cares about killing unless you're killing FOR someone, you know?",
WWBJ000P1,WW_StringTable.csv,Peasant-1,"I don't care about anything now, except for my fearless leader Fred!",
WWBJ001P1,WW_StringTable.csv,Peasant-1,"Hey, knock it off!",
WWBJ002P1,WW_StringTable.csv,Peasant-1,Quit it! I'm made of wood!,
WWBJ003P1,WW_StringTable.csv,Peasant-1,Ohhh ohhhh...,
WWBK000P2,WW_StringTable.csv,Peasant-2,Well then he should put his money where his mouth is and PAY US.,
WWBK001P2,WW_StringTable.csv,Peasant-2,It would be cool if we had some pawn shops in this town and I could SELL IT.,
WWBL000P2,WW_StringTable.csv,Peasant-2,I only care about how much I'm getting paid. ,
WWBL001RA,WW_StringTable.csv,Raz,"Okay, you got your money. Let's fight!",
WWBL002P2,WW_StringTable.csv,Peasant-2,"Well, I hope you saved a little dough to fix that broken bridge over there, cuz I can't get to the soldier until you do that.",
WWBL003P2,WW_StringTable.csv,Peasant-2,I'm ready. Send me over there!,
WWBL004P2,WW_StringTable.csv,Peasant-2,"Hey, you're not paying me enough to do that!",
WWBL005P2,WW_StringTable.csv,Peasant-2,ooohhh ohhh...,
WWBM000P3,WW_StringTable.csv,Peasant-3,"Man, I could buy a gun with that if there were a decent pawn shop in town.",
WWBM001P3,WW_StringTable.csv,Peasant-3,"If he cares, then why doesn't he give us guns so we can protect ourselves, huh?",
WWBN000P3,WW_StringTable.csv,Peasant-3,Careful. I have a gun.,
WWBN001RA,WW_StringTable.csv,Raz,Why aren't you using that gun I gave you?,
WWBN002P3,WW_StringTable.csv,Peasant-3,I'm too far away. You gotta move me closer to that soldier.,
WWBN003P3,WW_StringTable.csv,Peasant-3,Ohhhh.. Ohhhh...,
WWBO000KN,WW_StringTable.csv,Knight,"Oh, how I wish there were a gourmet restaurant in town so that I may take that coin and buy myself a fine meal.",
WWBO001KN,WW_StringTable.csv,Knight,Not enough to feed his troops anything but chipped beef on toast!,
WWBO002KN,WW_StringTable.csv,Knight,"Oooh, I can't believe I spoke the name of that dish!",
WWBO003KN,WW_StringTable.csv,Knight,"Excellent. Now take that gun and go shoot me a fine game pheasant, then bring it to my favorite chef in Paris--",
WWBO004RA,WW_StringTable.csv,Raz,It's not loaded.,
WWBO005KN,WW_StringTable.csv,Knight,"Ohhh, I'm going to faint.",
WWBP000KN,WW_StringTable.csv,Knight,"Please, do not distract me, for now my only thought is of storming that stronghold!",
WWBP002KN,WW_StringTable.csv,Knight,oooh... Ooohhh,
WWBQ000NP,WW_StringTable.csv,Napoleon,"Hey, do not try to bribe my troops! They are too loyal anyway, and would never leave me!",
WWBQ001SD,WW_StringTable.csv,Soldier,"Oui, oui oui but, uh... Call me two weeks. If we don't get more funding I'm going to jump ship!",
WWBQ002SD,WW_StringTable.csv,Soldier,Not as much as my leader does!,
WWBQ003NP,WW_StringTable.csv,Napoleon,"You got that right, kiddo!",
WWBQ004SD,WW_StringTable.csv,Soldier,"If I thought you knew how to use it, I would be frightened.",
WWBQ005RA,WW_StringTable.csv,Raz,"Hey, I was once an assassin I'll have you know!",
WWBQ006NP,WW_StringTable.csv,Napoleon,Hey! Don't touch my pieces!,
WWBQ007NP,WW_StringTable.csv,Napoleon,That is cheating!,
WWBR000RA,WW_StringTable.csv,Raz,"Man, this Salt Shaker is totally in the way.",
WWBR001RA,WW_StringTable.csv,Raz,I'll bet the real Napoleon never had to worry about stuff like this.,
WWBS000NP,WW_StringTable.csv,Napoleon,"Ha ha. Not bad, Fred!",
WWBS001FR,WW_StringTable.csv,Fred,What? What'd I do?,
WWBS002NP,WW_StringTable.csv,Napoleon,"You're doing better than usual, and I hate to end the fun...",
WWBS003NP,WW_StringTable.csv,Napoleon,"But I guess it's time to put an end to this, as usual.",
WWBS004NP,WW_StringTable.csv,Napoleon,Guard the bridge to the stronghold with your LIFE.,
WWBS005SD,WW_StringTable.csv,Soldier,None shall pass!,
WWBT000NP,WW_StringTable.csv,Napoleon,But... I... how...,
WWBT001NP,WW_StringTable.csv,Napoleon,RETREAT!,
WWBT002NP,WW_StringTable.csv,Napoleon,Everyone into the stronghold!,
WWBT003NP,WW_StringTable.csv,Napoleon,Raise the drawbridge immediatement!,
WWBT004NP,WW_StringTable.csv,Napoleon,Jam the mechanism with something! Anything!,
WWBT005RA,WW_StringTable.csv,Raz,"Hey, you can't jam the gears! That's cheating!",
WWBT006NP,WW_StringTable.csv,Napoleon,"All is fair in love and war! You have fought well, but that's as far as you shall go my friend!",
WWBT007FR,WW_StringTable.csv,Fred,Ha! We'll see about that!,
WWBT008RA,WW_StringTable.csv,Raz,Fred? Was that you?,
WWBT009FR,WW_StringTable.csv,Fred,Yeah! Come on! We're winning! ,
WWBT010FR,WW_StringTable.csv,Fred,All we have to do is unjam those gears.,
WWBT011RA,WW_StringTable.csv,Raz,"I'm on it, General.",
WWBU000NP,WW_StringTable.csv,Napoleon,Come talk to me if you need to know the rules!,
WWBU001RA,WW_StringTable.csv,Raz,"Excuse me, Mr. Bonaparte? But how do you play this game?",
WWBU002NP,WW_StringTable.csv,Napoleon,"Ah, this game is so easy, even a child like you can play it.",
WWBU003NP,WW_StringTable.csv,Napoleon,All my worthless descendent has to do is move a Knight piece into the center of my stronghold.,
WWBU004NP,WW_StringTable.csv,Napoleon,"Ha ha, but his Knight isn't even on the board. He's hiding out in that house.",
WWBU005RA,WW_StringTable.csv,Raz,"Well, maybe he's got a good reason--",
WWBU006NP,WW_StringTable.csv,Napoleon,"And Knights are good at storming strongholds, but they are no good at field combat.",
WWBU007NP,WW_StringTable.csv,Napoleon,So he'll also need a strong militia to fight my soldiers.,
WWBU008NP,WW_StringTable.csv,Napoleon,"But he has no militia. His people are hiding out in their houses--hopeless, hungry, and unarmed.",
WWBU009RA,WW_StringTable.csv,Raz,"Yeah, but--",
WWBU010NP,WW_StringTable.csv,Napoleon,"And if they came out to form a strong militia, they wouldn't be able to move around the board because I keep breaking his bridges!",
WWBU011RA,WW_StringTable.csv,Raz,"Hey, that part is your fault--",
WWBU012NP,WW_StringTable.csv,Napoleon,"He could easily fix the bridges I keep breaking if he just had a Carpenter, but his Carpenter is hiding out in his house, ha ha, afraid!",
WWBU013RA,WW_StringTable.csv,Raz,"Well, war is scary--",
WWBU014NP,WW_StringTable.csv,Napoleon,"So you see, it is an easy game, but Fred has already lost it.",
WWBU015RA,WW_StringTable.csv,Raz,Not this time! This time we're going to win!,
WWBU016FR,WW_StringTable.csv,Fred,No we're not!,
WWBU017RA,WW_StringTable.csv,Raz,"(Fred, shut up!)",
WWBU018RA,WW_StringTable.csv,Raz,"Hey, can you give me a little hint here?",
WWBU020NP,WW_StringTable.csv,Napoleon,"Well, you need to enlist a Carpenter so you can fix that bridge I broke, stupid.",
WWBU021NP,WW_StringTable.csv,Napoleon,Move the Carpenter over to the bridge so he can fix it!,
WWBU022NP,WW_StringTable.csv,Napoleon,You need to talk one of these peasants into forming a militia for you!,
WWBU023NP,WW_StringTable.csv,Napoleon,Move that Militiaman next to my Soldier! Do I have to tell you everything?,
WWBU024NP,WW_StringTable.csv,Napoleon,"Oh, cochon. You need to recruit another peasant if you want to keep fighting.",
WWBU025NP,WW_StringTable.csv,Napoleon,There is a huge Salt Shaker blocking the game board. Get rid of it!,
WWBU026NP,WW_StringTable.csv,Napoleon,You've got another broken bridge. Get your Carpenter!,
WWBU027NP,WW_StringTable.csv,Napoleon,Get that Militiaman over to where the action is so he can fight!,
WWBU028NP,WW_StringTable.csv,Napoleon,You're going to need one last brave soldier.,
WWBU029NP,WW_StringTable.csv,Napoleon,You will need to get your heartiest Knight out here onto the game board if you want to storm my stronghold.,
WWBU030NP,WW_StringTable.csv,Napoleon,"Ha! No help from me! You have fought well, but you will never get that drawbridge down, so your Knight will never be able to storm my stronghold!",
WWBU031NP,WW_StringTable.csv,Napoleon,"Oh, what are you waiting for? Why don't you move your Knight into the stronghold and get it over with?",
WWBV000P1,WW_StringTable.csv,Peasant-1,Ha! Ah! Take that!,
WWBV001P2,WW_StringTable.csv,Peasant-2,Pow! Gah! Oof!,
WWBV002P3,WW_StringTable.csv,Peasant-3,"Cool Musket, huh? Oh, wait. Have to reload here...",
WWBV003SD,WW_StringTable.csv,Soldier,Die! Arr! I kill you!,
WWBW000RA,WW_StringTable.csv,Raz,Ta da! That was easy!,
WWBW001RA,WW_StringTable.csv,Raz,"Stronghold stormed, game won!",
WWBW002NP,WW_StringTable.csv,Napoleon,"You have to storm the stronghold with your Knight, you stupid fool!",
WWBW003RA,WW_StringTable.csv,Raz,Oh.,
WWBX000RA,WW_StringTable.csv,Raz,"Hey, look! A Musket!",
WWBX001RA,WW_StringTable.csv,Raz,I'll bet I could arm our troops with that!,
WWBY000RA,WW_StringTable.csv,Raz,I'm saving this note for that guy who thinks Fred doesn't care about him.,
WWBY001RA,WW_StringTable.csv,Raz,I should give this to that guy who will fight for money.,
WWBY002RA,WW_StringTable.csv,Raz,I'm saving this coin until I find someone who could really use the money.,
WWBY003RA,WW_StringTable.csv,Raz,What good is this Musket! It's not even loaded?,
WWBZ000CN,WW_StringTable.csv,Carpenter,"Hey, I can't come out yet--there's some big thing in front of my door!",
WWBZ004KN,WW_StringTable.csv,Knight,"Oh bother, I am thwarted by some large object in my path. Could you be so good as to move it away from my door?",
WWBZ005CN,WW_StringTable.csv,Carpenter,Thanks. I was feeling trapped.,
WWBZ006P1,WW_StringTable.csv,Peasant-1,Alright. That's more like it.,
WWBZ007P2,WW_StringTable.csv,Peasant-2,That's better.,
WWBZ009KN,WW_StringTable.csv,Knight,Thank you. Here I come!,
WWCA000RA,WW_StringTable.csv,Raz,"Cheer up, Fred! You won the war!",
WWCA001FR,WW_StringTable.csv,Fred,I know. But now I'm bored.,
WWCA002RA,WW_StringTable.csv,Raz,Mind if I hang out?,
WWCA003FR,WW_StringTable.csv,Fred,Sure. Just don't expect me to be very entertaining.,
WWCB000RA,WW_StringTable.csv,Raz,"Can you believe a great battle was once fought here, on these very fields upon which you now, so peacefully, graze?",
WWCB001RA,WW_StringTable.csv,Raz,Many men died.,
WWCB002RA,WW_StringTable.csv,Raz,"Some did it for money, some for country.",
WWCB003RA,WW_StringTable.csv,Raz,And some did it just because they had guns.,
WWCB004RA,WW_StringTable.csv,Raz,"And now, no one is left on the battle fields, except you cows.",
WWCB005RA,WW_StringTable.csv,Raz,"Crazy world, isn't it?",
WWCB006RA,WW_StringTable.csv,Raz,Huh?,
WWCB007RA,WW_StringTable.csv,Raz,Don't you think it's crazy?,
WWCB008RA,WW_StringTable.csv,Raz,Mm?,
WWCB009RA,WW_StringTable.csv,Raz,"Hey, I'm talking to you, cow!",
WWCB010RA,WW_StringTable.csv,Raz,"We fought and died for you, so you could chew your cud in peace!",

WWCB012RA,WW_StringTable.csv,Raz,"Shame on you, ungrateful cow.",
WWCB013RA,WW_StringTable.csv,Raz,That's what it was like when the war was on.,
WWCB014RA,WW_StringTable.csv,Raz,And that!,
WWZB000TO,WW_StringTable.csv,System,Priceless Coin,
WWZB001TO,WW_StringTable.csv,System,Fred's Letter,
WWZB002TO,WW_StringTable.csv,System,Rifle,
ASZA004TO,WW_StringTable.csv,System,I'm getting the feeling that you won't get too far with this fella until you earn the power of INVISIBILITY. You'll earn that at RANK 30. Do you still want to jump in and try?,
WWZA009TO,WW_StringTable.csv,System,/AButton/Jump in,
