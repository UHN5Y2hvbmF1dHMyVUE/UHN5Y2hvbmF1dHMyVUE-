SACO001RA,SA_StringTable.csv,Raz,"Oh, yeah. Come to poppa!",
SACO002SA,SA_StringTable.csv,Sasha,"Raz, what have you done? This is not control! This is chaos!",
SACO003SA,SA_StringTable.csv,Sasha,I'll try to fix it. You stay here and keep their numbers under control.,
SAFB004SA,SA_StringTable.csv,Sasha,This is a censor.,
SAIN001SA,SA_StringTable.csv,Sasha,Welcome to my mind.,
SAIN002RA,SA_StringTable.csv,Raz,Huh. It's so empty.,
SAIN003RA,SA_StringTable.csv,Raz,"Uh, I mean--",
SAIN004SA,SA_StringTable.csv,Sasha,"There's more here than meets the eye, but I've learned to keep it under strict control.",
SAIN005SA,SA_StringTable.csv,Sasha,And that's what I'm going to teach you: control.,
SAIN006SA,SA_StringTable.csv,Sasha,"Your feelings, your fears, your anger. You must learn to control them, focus them, concentrate them, and release them.",
SAIN007RA,SA_StringTable.csv,Raz,As therapy?,
SAIN008SA,SA_StringTable.csv,Sasha,"No, as firepower!",
SAIN009SA,SA_StringTable.csv,Sasha,Say something hideous and horrible jumps out at you. Something so disgusting that it simply must die.,
SAIN010SA,SA_StringTable.csv,Sasha,"Ahhh, oh, so tacky... I can't... look... directly at it!",
SAIN011SA,SA_StringTable.csv,Sasha,"But I control those feelings, focus them, concentrate, and",
SAIN012SA,SA_StringTable.csv,Sasha,release!,
SAIN013SA,SA_StringTable.csv,Sasha,And the world is a better place.,
SAIN014SA,SA_StringTable.csv,Sasha,Your turn.,
SAIN015RA,SA_StringTable.csv,Raz,Okay...,
SAIN016RA,SA_StringTable.csv,Raz,Hggfgg!  Gahhh!,
SAIN017SA,SA_StringTable.csv,Sasha,Excellent. A victory for good taste.,
SAIN018SA,SA_StringTable.csv,Sasha,"Now, you must strive for precision when targeting. Say you were set upon by multiple attackers.",
SAIN019SA,SA_StringTable.csv,Sasha,Eh.,
SAIN020SA,SA_StringTable.csv,Sasha,Yecch.,
SAIN021SA,SA_StringTable.csv,Sasha,Bleh.,
SAIN022SA,SA_StringTable.csv,Sasha,But you need to dispense with them in a certain order. Eliminate these monsters in the proper sequence and we can move on to the next lesson.,
SAMC001SA,SA_StringTable.csv,Sasha,"Young man, I hope you've learned a lesson here today.",
SAMC002RA,SA_StringTable.csv,Raz,Yes I have.,
SAMC003RA,SA_StringTable.csv,Raz,That shooting things is fun and useful.,
SAMC004SA,SA_StringTable.csv,Sasha,"No, that once you lose control of your own mind, it's very hard to get it back!",
SAMC005RA,SA_StringTable.csv,Raz,Yes. One's thoughts must be 100% controlled at all times!,
SAMC006SA,SA_StringTable.csv,Sasha,"Well, no. Actually, if you try to completely suppress your undesirable feelings, they'll build and build and eventually explode.",
SAMC007RA,SA_StringTable.csv,Raz,"Oh. So, uh, what would happen if you were to, say, completely block off all your censor outlets?",
SAMC008SA,SA_StringTable.csv,Sasha,"Well, there would be a buildup of censor energy within, that would... uh eventually",
SAMC009SA,SA_StringTable.csv,Sasha,"Run, Razputin. Very fast.",
SAMC010SA,SA_StringTable.csv,Sasha,You are my own creation. I command you to stop!,
SAMC012SA,SA_StringTable.csv,Sasha,Ahhhhhhh!,
SAMC013SA,SA_StringTable.csv,Sasha,"Razputin, it's time to earn your merit badge!",
SASE001SA,SA_StringTable.csv,Sasha,Again.,
SASE002SA,SA_StringTable.csv,Sasha,Come now. Focus.,
SASE003SA,SA_StringTable.csv,Sasha,Shoot!,
SASE004SA,SA_StringTable.csv,Sasha,Repeat.,
SASE005SA,SA_StringTable.csv,Sasha,What are you waiting for?,
SASE006SA,SA_StringTable.csv,Sasha,Let's get moving.,
SASE007SA,SA_StringTable.csv,Sasha,Excellent.,
SASE008SA,SA_StringTable.csv,Sasha,Control.,
SASE009SA,SA_StringTable.csv,Sasha,Focus.,
SASE010SA,SA_StringTable.csv,Sasha,Concentrate.,
SASE011SA,SA_StringTable.csv,Sasha,Release.,
SASE012SA,SA_StringTable.csv,Sasha,Try it again.,
SASS001SA,SA_StringTable.csv,Sasha,Ahhhhh!,
SASS002SA,SA_StringTable.csv,Sasha,Ach!,
SASS003SA,SA_StringTable.csv,Sasha,Ai-ai-ai-ai-ai!,
SASS004SA,SA_StringTable.csv,Sasha,Razputin!,
SASS005SA,SA_StringTable.csv,Sasha,Oooh-ooh-oooh...,
SASS006SA,SA_StringTable.csv,Sasha,Peel me off and put me down!,
SASS007SA,SA_StringTable.csv,Sasha,Enough!,
SASS008SA,SA_StringTable.csv,Sasha,Oof!,
SASS009SA,SA_StringTable.csv,Sasha,Uggg!,
SASS010SA,SA_StringTable.csv,Sasha,Ow!,
SASS011SA,SA_StringTable.csv,Sasha,Gahhhh!,
SAAB001SA,SA_StringTable.csv,Sasha,"No, Raz, shoot them in order. Let's try this again.",
SAAC002RA,SA_StringTable.csv,Raz,This is controlled by that dial over there.,
SAAD003RA,SA_StringTable.csv,Raz,This is going to take forever. I wonder if I can speed it up somehow.,
SAAD004RA,SA_StringTable.csv,Raz,I wonder what would happen if I turned that dial up.,
SACD001RA,SA_StringTable.csv,Raz,"So, is this where I get a speech and learn another lesson?",
SACD002SA,SA_StringTable.csv,Sasha,No. Here's your merit badge. Let us never speak of this again.,
SAFB001SA,SA_StringTable.csv,Sasha,Now then...,
SAFB002SA,SA_StringTable.csv,Sasha,Is this what you saw in your vision?,
SAFB005SA,SA_StringTable.csv,Sasha,An integral part of any sane person's mind.,
SAFB006SA,SA_StringTable.csv,Sasha,"The censors roam through your psyche, looking for thoughts that don't belong.",
SAFB007SA,SA_StringTable.csv,Sasha,"Hallucinations, manias, waking dreams--the censors hunt them down and censor them out.",
SAFB008RA,SA_StringTable.csv,Raz,Why do they come after me? I'm not a mania!,
SAFB009SA,SA_StringTable.csv,Sasha,"Yes, but you are a foreign entity in my mind. You technically don't belong here.",
SAFB901SA,SA_StringTable.csv,Sasha,"Yes. Well, the Brain Tumbler could be malfunctioning. Or you could be insane.",
SAFB902SA,SA_StringTable.csv,Sasha,We'll test for that later. For now...,
SAFB010RA,SA_StringTable.csv,Raz,"So, what do I do?",
SAFB011SA,SA_StringTable.csv,Sasha,Blast it!,
SAFB012SA,SA_StringTable.csv,Sasha,That's the spirit.,
SAFB013RA,SA_StringTable.csv,Raz,I killed it.,
SAFB014SA,SA_StringTable.csv,Sasha,It was just a thought I was having. And it's not dead. It has just returned to its basic form--raw psychic energy. Go absorb it. It's good for your mental health.,
SAFB015SA,SA_StringTable.csv,Sasha,"Now I'll leave the machine on for you, so you can practice. You have to blast 1000 censors to earn your Marksmanship Merit Badge.",
SAFB016SA,SA_StringTable.csv,Sasha,"Come back every day for practice, and you should have enough in as little as three weeks!",
SAFB017RA,SA_StringTable.csv,Raz,Three weeks! I only have a few days to earn ALL my merit badges and become a Psychonaut.,
SAFB018SA,SA_StringTable.csv,Sasha,"Slow and steady wins the race, my eager young friend. Now practice. Slowly and carefully.",
SAFB019RA,SA_StringTable.csv,Raz,Oh man...,
SAFD001RA,SA_StringTable.csv,Raz,I need to stop whatever's shooting out these censors!,
SAFE001RA,SA_StringTable.csv,Raz,Those little censors are re-energizing the big one somehow.,
SAFF001RA,SA_StringTable.csv,Raz,This should stop any more censors from coming out of here.,
SAFG001SA,SA_StringTable.csv,Sasha,Destroy them all!,
SAFH002SA,SA_StringTable.csv,Sasha,"Well done, Raz. Keep shooting!",
SAFH003SA,SA_StringTable.csv,Sasha,Good. Again!,
SAFI004SA,SA_StringTable.csv,Sasha,Razputin! You must blast the emergency shut-down valves!,
SAFI005SA,SA_StringTable.csv,Sasha,It's the only way to close off the leak!,
SAFI006SA,SA_StringTable.csv,Sasha,Shut down all the valves on this face to get it under control!,
SAFI007SA,SA_StringTable.csv,Sasha,"Hurry, Razputin!",
SAAA000SA,SA_StringTable.csv,Sasha,"Yes, yes. We all know you can punch things.",
SAAA001SA,SA_StringTable.csv,Sasha,But you're supposed to be learning how to use your PSI Blast now.,
SAAA002SA,SA_StringTable.csv,Sasha,Try it without punching.,
SAAF000RA,SA_StringTable.csv,Raz,That's it! I've completely blocked off all of Sasha's censor outlets!  I can't wait to tell him.,
SAAG000SA,SA_StringTable.csv,Sasha,"Enough horseplay, Razputin! Destroy him!",
SAAG001SA,SA_StringTable.csv,Sasha,The small censors are feeding into his strength. You must stop them!,
SAAG002SA,SA_StringTable.csv,Sasha,"Destroy the valves that are emitting the small censors, Razputin!",
SAAG003SA,SA_StringTable.csv,Sasha,Raz! Shoot the valves! It's no use shooting the monster until you've destroyed every valve!,
SAAG004SA,SA_StringTable.csv,Sasha,"Don't forget to use your mental focus to lock on the valves as a target, and then blast them!",
SAZE004TO,SA_StringTable.csv,System,Use /LeftFlipper/ to lock mental focus.,
SAAG006SA,SA_StringTable.csv,Sasha,"Say, Razputin. Do you think you could reach in my pocket and hand me my cigarettes? ",
SAAG007SA,SA_StringTable.csv,Sasha,Excellent! You've shut down the valves so he cannot be rejuvenated. Now destroy him!,
SAAG008SA,SA_StringTable.csv,Sasha,"Use your mental focus Razputin! It will help you shoot accurately, and also help you with your evasive maneuvers!",
SAAG009SA,SA_StringTable.csv,Sasha,"When focused, you can tumble to the side, avoid his stamp, and circle around behind the monster!",
SAAG010SA,SA_StringTable.csv,Sasha,Watch out for those tumbling boils he's throwing at you. They're full of censors!,
SAAG011SA,SA_StringTable.csv,Sasha,"You can kill many small censors in one blow, if you jump up in the air above them and then smash the ground with your psychic fist.",
SAZE005TO,SA_StringTable.csv,System,Press /XButton/ while airborne to execute a Palm Bomb.,
SAAG013SA,SA_StringTable.csv,Sasha,"Oh, you. What a pleasant surprise.",
SAAG014SA,SA_StringTable.csv,Sasha,"Enough, Razputin! The beast must die, now!",
SAAG015SA,SA_StringTable.csv,Sasha,"If you are mentally focused, and executing a sideways tumble, it will be very hard for him to stamp you.",
SAAG016SA,SA_StringTable.csv,Sasha,"Razputin, if you could finish this off soon, I might get out of it with only a mild concussion.",
SAAG017SA,SA_StringTable.csv,Sasha,What? Who's there? I think I've lost my vision!,
SAAG018SA,SA_StringTable.csv,Sasha,"Why no, Aunt Bernie, of course I didn't get your phone calls or else I would have responded right away. ",
SAAG019SA,SA_StringTable.csv,Sasha,"My name is Yan Yanssen, I live in Wisconsin, I work in the lumber yard there...",
SAAG020SA,SA_StringTable.csv,Sasha,La di da... do do da dum...,
SAAG021SA,SA_StringTable.csv,Sasha,"Wow. Okay, that last hit brought me back. Where was I?",
SAAH000RA,SA_StringTable.csv,Raz,"Um, well, it sure seemed a lot bigger in my head.",
SAAH001SA,SA_StringTable.csv,Sasha,"Ah, problems often seem larger in our heads than they really are. That's an important lesson to learn.",
SAAH002RA,SA_StringTable.csv,Raz,But--,
SAAH003RA,SA_StringTable.csv,Raz,"Yes, but I was attacked in my own head.",
SAAH004SA,SA_StringTable.csv,Sasha,Um... Well...,
SAAH005SA,SA_StringTable.csv,Sasha,The machine is having a little trouble. I'm looking into it. Meanwhile...,
SAAH006SA,SA_StringTable.csv,Sasha,"As you absorb this energy, your mental health increases. ",
SAAH007SA,SA_StringTable.csv,Sasha,"But as you PSI Blast, you expend your will to do damage. ",
SAAH008SA,SA_StringTable.csv,Sasha,"So be on the look out for these small, dense clusters of raw psychic aggression.",
SAAH009SA,SA_StringTable.csv,Sasha,Absorb these as well to make sure you always have enough firepower.,
SAAH010RA,SA_StringTable.csv,Raz,Hm. They're coming out faster but still not fast enough.,
SAAH011RA,SA_StringTable.csv,Raz,Hm. Still not fast enough!,
SAAH012RA,SA_StringTable.csv,Raz,Uh oh.,
SAAI000SA,SA_StringTable.csv,Sasha,"Good shooting, Raz, but you are making it harder than it needs to be. ",
SAAI001SA,SA_StringTable.csv,Sasha,You need to practice locking your mental focus.,
SAAI002SA,SA_StringTable.csv,Sasha,It makes targeting and evasive maneuvers much easier.,
SAAI003SA,SA_StringTable.csv,Sasha,"Let's try again, this time lock your mental focus.",
SAAJ000SA,SA_StringTable.csv,Sasha,"Razputin, see those valves? That is where the censors are leaking out.",
SAAJ001SA,SA_StringTable.csv,Sasha,PSI Blast the valves to shut them down and get this area under control!,
SAAJ002SA,SA_StringTable.csv,Sasha,"Good, now the next one. You have to get them all.",
SAAJ003SA,SA_StringTable.csv,Sasha,"Good, well you got them all. ",
SAAJ004SA,SA_StringTable.csv,Sasha,"Oh, no. You close one leak down and another springs up!",
SAAJ005SA,SA_StringTable.csv,Sasha,Well come on. We've got to take care of these too!,
SAAK000SA,SA_StringTable.csv,Sasha,"Oh, no. What are you doing back in here?",
SAAK001RA,SA_StringTable.csv,Raz,Practicing.,
SAAK002SA,SA_StringTable.csv,Sasha,"Oh, would you like to run the course again?",
SAAK003RA,SA_StringTable.csv,Raz,"Yeah, I--run the course? But all that censor overload stuff... that was an accident. ",
SAAK004SA,SA_StringTable.csv,Sasha,"Oh, Raz. I knew you were going to overload that switch. I would have done the same thing at your age.",
SAAK005SA,SA_StringTable.csv,Sasha,It was all arranged to make you an expert fighter. And it worked.,
SAAK006SA,SA_StringTable.csv,Sasha,"Now, if you'd like to run the course again, just shoot the controller on any given face.",
SAAK007SA,SA_StringTable.csv,Sasha,"To close that face up and open another, shoot any censor valves you see.",
SAAK008SA,SA_StringTable.csv,Sasha,Fair enough?,
SAAK009RA,SA_StringTable.csv,Raz,Even the part where the giant censor had you on the stamp?,
SAAK010SA,SA_StringTable.csv,Sasha,"Okay, that part got a little out of hand. We won't be seeing him again.",
SAAK011SA,SA_StringTable.csv,Sasha,Razputin! I'm so glad to see you. What's happened?,

SAAK014SA,SA_StringTable.csv,Sasha,I... I have no idea. I seem to be... asleep... or in a trance...,
SAAK015RA,SA_StringTable.csv,Raz,Well don't worry about it. Ford and I are on the case.,
SAAK016SA,SA_StringTable.csv,Sasha,"Okay. I'd love to join you, but I think I need to focus on maintaining some level of brain activity.",
SAAK017RA,SA_StringTable.csv,Raz,"Ooh, I can help with that! Let me shoot up the place!",
SAZE000TO,SA_StringTable.csv,System,Move RIGHT /Joystick/ while holding /LeftFlipper/ to switch targets.,
