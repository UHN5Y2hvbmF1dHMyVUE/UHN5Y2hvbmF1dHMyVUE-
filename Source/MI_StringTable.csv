MITU007MI,MITU,Milla,Don't be afraid.,

MITU012MI,MITU,Milla,"Well, I'm gonna give you another one to think about.",
MITU013MI,MITU,Milla,"This is just a learner's permit, mind you. It only works when you're at my party.",
MITU014MI,MITU,Milla,"Focus on it, Razputin, and let's get hopping.",
MITU015MI,MITU,Milla,"Now, honey. I said Levitation.",
MITU016MI,MITU,Milla,"No, not that one.",
MITU017MI,MITU,Milla,No.,
MITU019MI,MITU,Milla,That one!,

MITU026MI,MITU,Milla,Bounce for Mamma!,
MITU027MI,MITU,Milla,There you go!,
MITU028MI,MITU,Milla,Want to take it higher? Try bouncing when you're already bouncing!,

MITU030MI,MITU,Milla,"Come on. Don't settle for just one bounce, darling.",
MITU031MI,MITU,Milla,Ooooh! You got it!,
MITU032MI,MITU,Milla,"Okay, now, just between you and me, this end of the party is dead.",
MITU033MI,MITU,Milla,Come find me on the other side of the party and I'll give you that merit badge for real.,
MITU034MI,MITU,Milla,"Never keep a girl waiting long, young man!",
MITU035MI,MITU,Milla,(Kiss.),
MITU036MI,MITU,Milla,You know Levitation gives you a little lift even when you're doing a regular jump.,
MITU037MI,MITU,Milla,Try it! Jump up and then jump again when in the air!,
MITU038MI,MITU,Milla,Exactly! Perfect!,
MITU039MI,MITU,Milla,Well rolled my friend.,
MITU040MI,MITU,Milla,"You know, I predict you are going to be the life of this party.",
MITU041MI,MITU,Milla,There's a pretty groovy scene in the next room.,
MITU042MI,MITU,Milla,"So, don't be a wall flower. Go mingle!",
MITU043MI,MITU,Milla,"Oh, some of these places can be so exclusive!",
MITU044MI,MITU,Milla,"Anyway, I'm sure once you show them what a rock star you are, doors are gonna open for you baby.",
MITU045MI,MITU,Milla,"You know I love you, darling, but you have to make the camera love you too.",
MITU046MI,MITU,Milla,"In fact, you have to make all the cameras love you.",
MITU047MI,MITU,Milla,Being a rock star isn't easy!,
MITU048MI,MITU,Milla,I know you can do it!,
MITU049MI,MITU,Milla,Razputin dominates the airwaves!,
MITU050MI,MITU,Milla,I need rock stars like you at my party!,
MITU051MI,MITU,Milla,Get down here!,
MITU052MI,MITU,Milla,"Wooo hooo! Watch out for those bumpers, darling.",
MITU053MI,MITU,Milla,Ooooh! Look at you go!,
MITU054MI,MITU,Milla,You're like a little pinball in there!,
MITU055MI,MITU,Milla,Now light up all those lights if you're ready to come out.,
MITU056MI,MITU,Milla,"Hey, look at you brightening up the place!",
MITU057MI,MITU,Milla,"Oh, no. Party crashers.",
MITU058MI,MITU,Milla,"Why must someone always try to ruin the party, hm?",
MITU059MI,MITU,Milla,"Just do what I do, darling. Ignore them and they'll go away.",
MITU060MI,MITU,Milla,"Ooh, I see other people find your thoughts uplifting as well.",
MITU061MI,MITU,Milla,Darling. What are you doing down here?,
MITU062MI,MITU,Milla,The party is upstairs.,
MITU063MI,MITU,Milla,These are just some old demons of mine.,
MITU064MI,MITU,Milla,Everybody has them.,
MITU065MI,MITU,Milla,Now move along. Nothing to see here.,
MITU066MI,MITU,Milla,Darling.,
MITU067MI,MITU,Milla,"If you're looking for the make-out room, you've come to the WRONG place.",
MITU068MI,MITU,Milla,"These bouncers can be so strict, you know.",
MITU069MI,MITU,Milla,But I'm afraid this is a pretty exclusive party.,
MITU071MI,MITU,Milla,Thank goodness you're a winner!,
MITU072MI,MITU,Milla,Now roll!,
MITU073MI,MITU,Milla,"Hang on, darling!",
MITU074MI,MITU,Milla,Weeeee!,
MITU075MI,MITU,Milla,Outstanding!,
MITU076MI,MITU,Milla,Superb!,
MITU077MI,MITU,Milla,You're going to be at my party in no time!,
MITU078MI,MITU,Milla,I'd better make sure I have enough onion dip.,
MITU079MI,MITU,Milla,"I love onion dip, don't you?",
MITU080MI,MITU,Milla,You know those long falls can really be a pain.,
MITU081MI,MITU,Milla,"Next time you're falling, try using your thoughts like a balloon.",
MITU082MI,MITU,Milla,If you float in some areas you might get a little more mmmmf than usual.,
MITU083MI,MITU,Milla,Who's that I see?,
MITU084MI,MITU,Milla,"It's Razputin, the Rolling Rock Star! In the flesh!",
MITU085MI,MITU,Milla,"And just in time. This party was dying without you, darling.",
MITU086MI,MITU,Milla,"Here, I have a little party favor for you.",
MITU087MI,MITU,Milla,So cute! (Kiss.),
MITU088MI,MITU,Milla,"Milla, save us!",
MITU089MI,MITU,Milla,"Help us, Milla!",
MITU090MI,MITU,Milla,"Milla, where are you?",
MITU091MI,MITU,Milla,Ow! It's hot! It's burning!,
MITU092MI,MITU,Milla,"Milla, why don't you help us?",
MITU093MI,MITU,Milla,Why did you let us die?,
MITU094MI,MITU,Milla,"We're all alone now, Milla.",
MITU095MI,MITU,Milla,Miiiiiiillaaaaa...,
MITU096MI,MITU,Milla,No parking on the dance floor!,
MITU097MI,MITU,Milla,I like your style Razputin!,
MITU098MI,MITU,Milla,"You have to dance, dance, dance baby! Like some sort of crazy bat!",
MITU099MI,MITU,Milla,Which do you like better--spinach or onion dip?,
MITU100MI,MITU,Milla,"You know, I was hoping someone would bring that spinach dip in a bread bowl thing to the party, but nobody did.",
MITU101MI,MITU,Milla,"Then again, last time I had that, I walked around for an hour with spinach stuck between my teeth!",
MITU102MI,MITU,Milla,"Hey, you two! Get a room!",
MITU103MI,MITU,Milla,"Oh, thank you babydoll! So do you!",
MITU104MI,MITU,Milla,"Yeah, yeah, yeah. Call me!",

MITU107MI,MITU,Milla,"Oh, I'm so glad you guys could make it!",
MITU108MI,MITU,Milla,"Yeah, isn't it?",
MITU109MI,MITU,Milla,Just throw your coat on the bed there.,
MITU110MI,MITU,Milla,What are you talking about? You look great!,
MITU111MI,MITU,Milla,"Okay, that's definitely not Francois' wife!",
MITU112MI,MITU,Milla,Oh my. Are THOSE two back together?,
MITU113MI,MITU,Milla,"No, no, no. Don't drink that. I saw someone put a cigarette out in there.",
MITU114MI,MITU,Milla,"Yay, shake that thing, beautiful.",
MITU115MI,MITU,Milla,Down the hallway to the right!,
MITU116MI,MITU,Milla,"No, no. That's a closet.",
MITU117MI,MITU,Milla,Now go mingle in the real world for a while.,
MITU118MI,MITU,Milla,And tell Sasha I say hello!,
MITU200MI,MITU,Milla,"Now darling, the best way to learn Levitation is to just try it!",
MITU201MI,MITU,Milla,I'm going to give you a Levitation Learner's Permit. It will only work while you're in my mind.,
MITU202MI,MITU,Milla,"After you finish my course, I'll give you the real thing, baby.",
MITU203MI,MITU,Milla,First you gotta show me you know how to use it!,
MITU020MI,MITU,Milla,That's it! You see? Your thoughts can lift you up and carry you around.,
MITU204MI,MITU,Milla,"Now bounce on up here and follow me, darling!",
MITU205MI,MITU,Milla,Now for this last one you're really gonna have to fly.,
MITU206MI,MITU,Milla,"You're going to have to double bubble jump, and then float to make it all the way across.",
MITU207MI,MITU,Milla,It's gonna be tough.,
MITU316MI,MITU,Milla,Thank goodness you are a winner!,
MITU208MI,MITU,Milla,"Rhythm is everything, darling. It goes bounce, bounce, then float. Bounce bounce float!",
MITU209MI,MITU,Milla,"See that draft up above, darling? Jump into it and float and see where it takes you!",
MITU210MI,MITU,Milla,"When you are levitating, you are also protected from all sorts of icky things.",
MITU211MI,MITU,Milla,"But some things, like those spikes, those are always bad news, whether you are levitating or not. So watch out!",
MITU212MI,MITU,Milla,Mmmm. That shouldn't be happening.,
MITU213MI,MITU,Milla,"Darling, do you have some problems with water? Do you want to talk about it?",
MITU214RA,MITU,Raz,"Uh, it's a long story. Maybe later.",
MITU215MI,MITU,Milla,"Okay, I'm always here for you, darling. Let me just say that it's very normal for boys your age.",
MITU216MI,MITU,Milla,"Okay, it's time to see how fast you are, darling.",
MITU217MI,MITU,Milla,Ready?,
MITU218MI,MITU,Milla,On your marks!,
MITU219MI,MITU,Milla,Get set!,
MITU220MI,MITU,Milla,"Go, baby, go!",
MITU221MI,MITU,Milla,You did it! You are quick like greasy lightning!,
MITU222MI,MITU,Milla,"I'm so proud of you, darling!",
MITU223MI,MITU,Milla,"You're so fast you'll be at my party in no time, eh?",
MITU224MI,MITU,Milla,"Oh, darling. You looked good, but sometimes speed is important.",
MITU225MI,MITU,Milla,Why don't you try the race again?,
MITU226MI,MITU,Milla,"Okay, if you want to get up to where the action is, you are going to have to do a lot of floating in this room, baby.",
MITU227MI,MITU,Milla,Good thing you are so light on your feet.,
MITU401MI,MITU,Milla,"Darling, float over here, will you? These rings aren't spinning and they're ruining my party!",
MIAA000MI,MIAA,Milla,"Once you get up in the air, try using your thoughts as a balloon to float.",
MIAA001MI,MIAA,Milla,"Just jump for those rings, as high as you can, and then do your PSI Float!",
MIAA002MI,MIAA,Milla,"Don't be afraid, darling!",
MIAA003MI,MIAA,Milla,"Stay on the ball in here, Razputin, if you want to get higher.",
MIAA004MI,MIAA,Milla,"And see if you can get all those rings spinning, mister DJ!",
MIAA005MI,MIAA,Milla,"Woo-hoo! You are the sugar in my bowl, darling.",
MIAA006MI,MIAA,Milla,"Now just follow the flowers, won't you? And try to stay rolling at all times! That is the theme of this party!",
MIAA007MI,MIAA,Milla,"Fantastic! What style you have, young man!",
MIAA008MI,MIAA,Milla,"Now I'm not saying that you will fall, but if you ever did, I'll put a ball return down here for you.",
MIAA009MI,MIAA,Milla,Just jump in there if you need to come back up here in a hurry.,
MIAA010MI,MIAA,Milla,"Remember to use your PSI Float. I'm not saying it won't ever let you down, but it will let you down nice and slow.",
MIAA011MI,MIAA,Milla,"Thank you, sweetie. I feel so much better now!",
MIAA012MI,MIAA,Milla,Come on. Let's take it a little higher now.,
MIAA013MI,MIAA,Milla,"Ooh, look at the crowd. Things are starting to pick up!",
MIAA014MI,MIAA,Milla,"Careful, darling. If you're not on the ball when you enter that circle you might be seeing stars instead of being one.",
MIAA015MI,MIAA,Milla,My little elevator here is depressed. It's sad about these rings not spinning. Don't you hate seeing these rings just sitting still?,
MIAA016MI,MIAA,Milla,"Now, why would you want to come in here. Come on, this room's no fun. Let's leave, baby.",
MIAA017MI,MIAA,Milla,"Now, you DEFINITELY don't want to go in there! That's a party killer right there.",
MIAA018MI,MIAA,Milla,Lucky for you I have my Nightmares under control.,
MIAA019MI,MIAA,Milla,Lucky for you I have my Demons under control.,
MIAA020MI,MIAA,Milla,"These things can take you to a world of pain, trust me.",
MIAA021MI,MIAA,Milla,"Now, quick. Let's get back to the party, okay?",
MIAA022MI,MIAA,Milla,Now you're going to have to use your PSI Float again to get those rings spinning.,
MIAB000CM,MIAB,Clem,"Hey, hey. This isn't slam dancing.",
MIAB001CF,MIAB,Crystal,"Wow. You dance hard, Raz!",
MIAB002CP,MIAB,Chops,"Hey, I need room to groove.",
MIAB003EF,MIAB,Elton,"Wow, and I thought I was the worst dancer here. But you're really bad!",
MIAB004JT,MIAB,J.T.,Go stampede someone else!,
MIAB005EL,MIAB,Elka,Why are boys such pests!?,
MIAB006CH,MIAB,Chloe,"That's not how we dance on my planet, Earthling.",
MIAB007RA,MIAB,Raz,"Hey, wanna dance?",
MIAB008CM,MIAB,Clem,"Hey, sure! We're all dancing!",
MIAB009CF,MIAB,Crystal,Yay! I already am! Come join us!,

MIAB011EF,MIAB,Elton,Um. No thanks Raz.,
MIAB012JT,MIAB,J.T.,"Um, why don't you go ask Elka? She loves to dance.",
MIAB013EL,MIAB,Elka,You'd better back off or my boyfriend James will go nuts. He's so jealous and protective of me.,
MIAB014CH,MIAB,Chloe,"Yes, teach me of your Earth rhythms.",
MIAB015RA,MIAB,Raz,"Hey, will you teach me how to dance?",
MIAB016MD,MIAB,Male-Dancer,"Watch and learn, kid.",

MIAE002MI,MIAE,Milla,Of course! The party never ends in here!,
MIAE003MI,MIAE,Milla,Roll away!,
MIAE004MI,MIAE,Milla,"I'm going to be in another part of my mind, tending a party I'm having with some old memories, but you have fun here.",
MIAE006MI,MIAE,Milla,Razputin? I... I don't really know...,
MIAE007MI,MIAE,Milla,I was on the dock and all of a sudden there was this... thing...,
MIAE008MI,MIAE,Milla,And then everything went black.,
MIAE009RA,MIAE,Raz,"I believe you've been abducted, probably by Coach Oleander.",
MIAE010RA,MIAE,Raz,He's trying to take over the world.,
MIAE011MI,MIAE,Milla,"Oh, Morry.",
