BVDA046DA,BV_StringTable.csv,Dalmatian,Hm. Your argument has many strong points.,
BVDA047DA,BV_StringTable.csv,Dalmatian,Especially around that area where you said the word paying,
BVDA048DA,BV_StringTable.csv,Dalmatian,I liked that.,
BVDA050DA,BV_StringTable.csv,Dalmatian,"Well, I guess it might cheer up the joint to get rid of some of these eyesores outta here.",
BVDA051DA,BV_StringTable.csv,Dalmatian,"Come on, I'll give you a tour of the atrocities. I just hope you got a strong stomach.",
BVDA018DA,BV_StringTable.csv,Dalmatian,Famous painter? Edgar?,
BVDA019DA,BV_StringTable.csv,Dalmatian,"Pffft! Yeah, right!",
BVDA020DA,BV_StringTable.csv,Dalmatian,"Look, I'm sorry, but eating lunch every day in the art teacher's room does not make you a famous painter.",
BVDA021DA,BV_StringTable.csv,Dalmatian,"Anyway, he only did that to hide out from the school wrestling team.",
BVDA022DA,BV_StringTable.csv,Dalmatian,"Oh, whaddya mean wild animals? Like dogs, eh?",
BVDA023DA,BV_StringTable.csv,Dalmatian,"Oh, you got a problem with me now?",
BVDA024DA,BV_StringTable.csv,Dalmatian,"Oh, you don't think I'm tough now?",
BVDA025DA,BV_StringTable.csv,Dalmatian,"Why, 'cause I'm a Dalmatian?",
BVDA026DA,BV_StringTable.csv,Dalmatian,"Hey, we can't all be St. Bernards and Bulldogs, you know!",
BVDA027DA,BV_StringTable.csv,Dalmatian,(Sigh.),
BVDA028DA,BV_StringTable.csv,Dalmatian,"Look, man. Are you gonna buy something or what?",
BVDA029DA,BV_StringTable.csv,Dalmatian,"No way. In fact, he used to be the captain of his high school wrestling team!",
BVDA030DA,BV_StringTable.csv,Dalmatian,"He took them all the way to the state semi-finals one year, and then he...",
BVDA031DA,BV_StringTable.csv,Dalmatian,...he choked.,
BVDA032DA,BV_StringTable.csv,Dalmatian,Cost the team the entire match.,
BVDA034DA,BV_StringTable.csv,Dalmatian,"No, Edgar's girlfriend Lana Panzoni dumped him after the first period for Dean Legrante, the head of her cheerleading squad.",
BVDA035DA,BV_StringTable.csv,Dalmatian,Teglee was worthless after that.,
BVDA036DA,BV_StringTable.csv,Dalmatian,The other team just tossed him around the rest of the day like a half sack of pork rinds.,
BVDA037DA,BV_StringTable.csv,Dalmatian,"Oh, man. His squad hated him after that. The whole school did.",
BVDA038DA,BV_StringTable.csv,Dalmatian,Ohhhhhhh. Riiigggght.,
BVDA039DA,BV_StringTable.csv,Dalmatian,"Yeah, they exist.",
BVDA040DA,BV_StringTable.csv,Dalmatian,"Not made up at all, those two.",
BVDA041DA,BV_StringTable.csv,Dalmatian,Sheesh.,
BVDA042DA,BV_StringTable.csv,Dalmatian,"Hey, I got some original Picassos over here if you're interested, by the way...",
BVDA043DA,BV_StringTable.csv,Dalmatian,"Yes, run! Run from the horror!",
BVDA049DA,BV_StringTable.csv,Dalmatian,Thanks.,
BVDA052DA,BV_StringTable.csv,Dalmatian,"Hey, I can call it that. You can't.",
BVDA053DA,BV_StringTable.csv,Dalmatian,"Well, not until you pay for it at least.",
BVDA054DA,BV_StringTable.csv,Dalmatian,Okay what I was going for here was a creeping vine. The kind that grows up walls?,
BVDA055DA,BV_StringTable.csv,Dalmatian,But it just ended up looking like a truck driver's hairy back.,
BVDA056DA,BV_StringTable.csv,Dalmatian,But without the charisma.,
BVDA057DA,BV_StringTable.csv,Dalmatian,"This, believe it or not, is supposed to be a rose.",
BVDA058DA,BV_StringTable.csv,Dalmatian,"You know, if you gave a woman a rose that looked like this, she'd slap you.",
BVDA059DA,BV_StringTable.csv,Dalmatian,Ya see what I'm talking about?,
BVDA060DA,BV_StringTable.csv,Dalmatian,This stuff reeks.,
BVDA061DA,BV_StringTable.csv,Dalmatian,Ew.,
BVDA062DA,BV_StringTable.csv,Dalmatian,"I recommend you don't look directly at this one. It is so awful, you could mess up your eyes.",
BVDA063DA,BV_StringTable.csv,Dalmatian,"Ewww, so bad...",
BVDA064DA,BV_StringTable.csv,Dalmatian,Whoa! I forgot how crummy this one was.,
BVDA065DA,BV_StringTable.csv,Dalmatian,I can't believe I painted this.,
BVDA066DA,BV_StringTable.csv,Dalmatian,Ach!,
BVDA067DA,BV_StringTable.csv,Dalmatian,"This one is so bad, someone should take a rolled-up newspaper and smack it.",
BVDA068DA,BV_StringTable.csv,Dalmatian,Seriously. What a load.,
BVDA069DA,BV_StringTable.csv,Dalmatian,This looks like electric clown barf in space.,
BVDA070DA,BV_StringTable.csv,Dalmatian,Terrible!,
BVDA071DA,BV_StringTable.csv,Dalmatian,"Uhhh, uhhh I'm sorry you had to see this.",
BVDA072DA,BV_StringTable.csv,Dalmatian,Ug.,
BVDA073DA,BV_StringTable.csv,Dalmatian,I deserve to get my nose rubbed in this one.,
BVDA074DA,BV_StringTable.csv,Dalmatian,This painting reminds me of my grandpa's last year alive...,
BVDA075DA,BV_StringTable.csv,Dalmatian,...just one terrible stroke on top of another.,
BVDA076DA,BV_StringTable.csv,Dalmatian,"Really, I should just take this one out back and bury it.",
BVDA077DA,BV_StringTable.csv,Dalmatian,Ech! Somebody light a match! This one really stinks.,
BVDA078DA,BV_StringTable.csv,Dalmatian,Woof! That's all I gotta say about that.,
BVDA079DA,BV_StringTable.csv,Dalmatian,Black velvet hasn't been abused like this since the last time Mom got drunk in her prom dress.,
BVDA080DA,BV_StringTable.csv,Dalmatian,Just awful!,
BVDA081DA,BV_StringTable.csv,Dalmatian,Bleech!,
BVDI008RA,BV_StringTable.csv,Raz,Yow. What's that smell?,
BVDI000DR,BV_StringTable.csv,Dragon,"That smells like fear, boy!",
BVDI009RA,BV_StringTable.csv,Raz,"Yeah... No, I mean that fart smell.",
BVDI001DR,BV_StringTable.csv,Dragon,That's fear! RAWRRRR!,
BVDI010RA,BV_StringTable.csv,Raz,"No, I'm talking about an actual smell. It's like if stink bombs laid eggs and then those went bad.",
BVDI002DR,BV_StringTable.csv,Dragon,"That's sulfur. It's part of the dragon costume, kid.",
BVED000ED,BV_StringTable.csv,Edgar,"If you are curious about the load-bearing capacity of cardhouses, please conduct your experiments on SOMEONE ELSE'S HOUSE OF CARDS!",
BVED001ED,BV_StringTable.csv,Edgar,"The cards are large, yes, but it is still a house of cards. KEEP OFF!",
BVED002ED,BV_StringTable.csv,Edgar,"Jumping on the house of cards, stumbling into the house of cards, driving your glowing ball through the house of cards: none of these activities help me.",
BVED003ED,BV_StringTable.csv,Edgar,"Please, boy, I must have those queens!",
BVED004ED,BV_StringTable.csv,Edgar,Perfect! One step closer... to her.,
BVED005ED,BV_StringTable.csv,Edgar,"Ah, that is exactly the card I need!",
BVED000RA,BV_StringTable.csv,Raz,"Wow. It looks like you can walk right up there now, Edgar.",
BVED004RA,BV_StringTable.csv,Raz,"Here you go, Edgar.",
BVED005RA,BV_StringTable.csv,Raz,"I got some cards for you, Edgar.",
BVED006RA,BV_StringTable.csv,Raz,This one was a real pain in the butt to get.,
BVED007RA,BV_StringTable.csv,Raz,"I hope these things are worth it, Edgar.",
BVEI000EA,BV_StringTable.csv,Eagle,Ca-caw.,
BVEI013RA,BV_StringTable.csv,Raz,That's it? Ca--MAN! That's ss-,
BVEI001EA,BV_StringTable.csv,Eagle,Ca-caw. Ca-caw.,
BVEQ002ED,BV_StringTable.csv,Edgar,Thank you! I'll take any other cards you have as well.,
BVHO000RA,BV_StringTable.csv,Raz,Now that looks like a good place to hang a painting!,
BVMB000BD,BV_StringTable.csv,Bulldog,"Oh my god, I'm deaf!",
BVMB012RA,BV_StringTable.csv,Raz,Can you hear me? You're getting sleepy.  But not too sleepy to go paint the billboard.,
BVMB002BD,BV_StringTable.csv,Bulldog,"What? Oh my god. Hey, ""god"" is ""dog"" spelled backwards!",
BVMB003BD,BV_StringTable.csv,Bulldog,"Whoa, whoa wait a minute. ""God"" is ""cat"" spelled backwards! Oh no. No no no no no.",
BVMB004BD,BV_StringTable.csv,Bulldog,I'm shaving just like daddy!,
BVMB013RA,BV_StringTable.csv,Raz,I think I solved your problem. Watch this.,
BVMB000MA,BV_StringTable.csv,Matador,"I had my doubts, but--",
BVMB001MA,BV_StringTable.csv,Matador,"But I'm right as usual. Really nice job, genius. Now go back out there and finish the job.",
BVMI002MA,BV_StringTable.csv,Matador,"Ah, the towel boy.  Oh, it's you.  Get out.",
BVMI001MA,BV_StringTable.csv,Matador,I see the sign's not finished. That's what I get for trusting a bullfight to an eight year old.,
BVMO000MA,BV_StringTable.csv,Matador,Hmmm. It's not great.,
BVMO001MA,BV_StringTable.csv,Matador,But I suppose it's just barely good enough. Come see me if you still want your reward.,
BVMO000RA,BV_StringTable.csv,Raz,"You know, your advice didn't work.",
BVMO002MA,BV_StringTable.csv,Matador,Really? Then here's some new advice: I don't know what you're talking about.,
BVMO001RA,BV_StringTable.csv,Raz,How about that reward?,
BVMO003MA,BV_StringTable.csv,Matador,"Fine, then. One autograph.",
BVMP005MA,BV_StringTable.csv,Matador,"Ah, you must be the towel boy!",
BVMP008MA,BV_StringTable.csv,Matador,You want an autograph? I don't just hand those out.,
BVMP009MA,BV_StringTable.csv,Matador,And that's a good lesson for you: anticipate disappointment. Take me: I'm the greatest bullfighter who's ever lived. Yet my upcoming match against the town bull has received virtually no marketing support.,
BVMP010MA,BV_StringTable.csv,Matador,"A towering advertisement was supposed to have been painted just outside my window. But, as you can see, the job hasn't even been started.",
BVMP005RA,BV_StringTable.csv,Raz,I think that bull is trampling anyone who tries to paint on the wall. Maybe you could stop it.,
BVMP011MA,BV_StringTable.csv,Matador,"Hmmm ...  so instead of challenging the bull before a stadium packed with screaming women, you want me to fight it on the street in front of one dog and one child wearing a crude towel boy disguise. That's a terrible idea.",
BVRO005RA,BV_StringTable.csv,Raz,"I should find a proper hook for this painting, so it will come to life like that dog said.",
BVRO000RA,BV_StringTable.csv,Raz,I should give this rose to someone who'd appreciate it.,
BVRO001RA,BV_StringTable.csv,Raz,I'll bet there's a lonely lady out there somewhere who could use a little cheering up.,
BVRO002RA,BV_StringTable.csv,Raz,Maybe one of those ladies hiding behind the shutters?,
BVST010RA,BV_StringTable.csv,Raz,"Hey, have you seen any REALLY BIG playing cards around here?",
BVST012RA,BV_StringTable.csv,Raz,I'd like to buy some more art.,
BVST000SB,BV_StringTable.csv,St.Bernard,"No? Uh, okay.",
BVST001SB,BV_StringTable.csv,St.Bernard,Where'd ya go?,
BVST003SB,BV_StringTable.csv,St.Bernard,Moving right along...,
BVST004SB,BV_StringTable.csv,St.Bernard,"Yeah, yeah. Check 'em all out of course. I got nowhere to go.",
BVST005SB,BV_StringTable.csv,St.Bernard,What? You don't say?,
BVST006SB,BV_StringTable.csv,St.Bernard,Heck! Alright then!,
BVST007SB,BV_StringTable.csv,St.Bernard,"Really? Uh, uh, sure!",
BVST008SB,BV_StringTable.csv,St.Bernard,"Hold on. Uh, let me get my salesman thing going here...",
BVST009SB,BV_StringTable.csv,St.Bernard,"I'd love to, but I'm all sold out!",
BVST010SB,BV_StringTable.csv,St.Bernard,I guess my rep WAS right. This IS my year!,
BVST068SB,BV_StringTable.csv,St.Bernard,I'm all sold out!,
BVST012SB,BV_StringTable.csv,St.Bernard,Enjoy your new art there!,
BVST013SB,BV_StringTable.csv,St.Bernard,"You hang that in just the right spot, I promise you it will really come to life for ya!",
BVST011SB,BV_StringTable.csv,St.Bernard,"Oh, ok.",
BVST016SB,BV_StringTable.csv,St.Bernard,Struck out again.,
BVST017SB,BV_StringTable.csv,St.Bernard,Is it my painting? My salesmanship? Me?,
BVST018SB,BV_StringTable.csv,St.Bernard,"Good, good, good.  There you go!",
BVST019SB,BV_StringTable.csv,St.Bernard,"You want, like, a ribbon around that or something?  No?  Okay.",
BVST020SB,BV_StringTable.csv,St.Bernard,Made a good choice there I think.,
BVST001RA,BV_StringTable.csv,Raz,"Hey, can I buy some art?",
BVST003RA,BV_StringTable.csv,Raz,I think I hate that bull a lot.,
BVST004RA,BV_StringTable.csv,Raz,Hi. Could you please paint me a big gun please?,
BVST005RA,BV_StringTable.csv,Raz,"Okay, I'm off.",
BVST006RA,BV_StringTable.csv,Raz,"Uh-huh. So, the cards? You know where they are?",
BVST007RA,BV_StringTable.csv,Raz,Those are exactly the cards I need! Where are they?,
BVST011RA,BV_StringTable.csv,Raz,Where did you say those cards were again?,
BVST008RA,BV_StringTable.csv,Raz,What do you mean trapped? Are you a prisoner of art just like Edgar?,
BVST009RA,BV_StringTable.csv,Raz,"Okay, promise me you won't take this the wrong way, but you ARE a dog.",
BVST021SB,BV_StringTable.csv,St.Bernard,"Oh, man. I wish.  That would solve that would solve a lot of my problems.",
BVST022SB,BV_StringTable.csv,St.Bernard,But no this is everything I know how to paint right here.,
BVST023SB,BV_StringTable.csv,St.Bernard,"Man, that's embarrassing...",
BVST024SB,BV_StringTable.csv,St.Bernard,"Now that takes me back. Poker night with the guys... Man, I miss those dogs.",
BVST025SB,BV_StringTable.csv,St.Bernard,"Oh, right. Well, I do know about these four lost queens...",
BVST026SB,BV_StringTable.csv,St.Bernard,"But that's all. Can't do much with four queens, can ya?",
BVST027SB,BV_StringTable.csv,St.Bernard,Forget about it! They're guarded by some pretty nasty characters. Not to mention El Odio.,
BVST028SB,BV_StringTable.csv,St.Bernard,You're better off just hanging out here and turning your head just a teensy bit to the left.,
BVST029SB,BV_StringTable.csv,St.Bernard,"Oh, trust me. You'll hate him even more as time goes by. When he first trapped me in this alley, I thought he was only mildly annoying.",
BVST030SB,BV_StringTable.csv,St.Bernard,I'm a prisoner of that stupid bull!,
BVST031SB,BV_StringTable.csv,St.Bernard,"I don't wanna get gored, so I hide out in the alley, like a...",
BVST032SB,BV_StringTable.csv,St.Bernard,...like a low-down dog!,
BVST033SB,BV_StringTable.csv,St.Bernard,"Yeah but I'm a SAINT BERNARD, man!",
BVST034SB,BV_StringTable.csv,St.Bernard,"I should be up in the highlands, above the tree line!",
BVST035SB,BV_StringTable.csv,St.Bernard,Keg of brandy around my friggin' neck! Seeing the world!,
BVST036SB,BV_StringTable.csv,St.Bernard,And finding more things to paint than this junk.,
BVST037SB,BV_StringTable.csv,St.Bernard,Which is all for sale by the way.,
BVST038SB,BV_StringTable.csv,St.Bernard,"Well, see ya. Keep off the street now.",
BVST039SB,BV_StringTable.csv,St.Bernard,Ahem.,
BVST040SB,BV_StringTable.csv,St.Bernard,"Ah, the guitar. Mysterious and musical and...",
BVST041SB,BV_StringTable.csv,St.Bernard,"...blue. Look at it there, with it's",
BVST042SB,BV_StringTable.csv,St.Bernard,With it's strings. Uh,
BVST043SB,BV_StringTable.csv,St.Bernard,"Nothing woos the ladies quite like a guitar, am I right?",
BVST044SB,BV_StringTable.csv,St.Bernard,(Am I? I really can't remember. Been in this alley a long time.),
BVST045SB,BV_StringTable.csv,St.Bernard,"Anyway, how about it? Eh? Guitar? Yeah?",
BVST046SB,BV_StringTable.csv,St.Bernard,I'll make ya a special deal.,
BVST047SB,BV_StringTable.csv,St.Bernard,"Yes, yes. Uhh, the rose...",
BVST048SB,BV_StringTable.csv,St.Bernard,Timeless symbol of the... of the... flower...,
BVST049SB,BV_StringTable.csv,St.Bernard,...of love...,
BVST050SB,BV_StringTable.csv,St.Bernard,"Um... romance, and uh...",
BVST051SB,BV_StringTable.csv,St.Bernard,This one's real cheap.,
BVST052SB,BV_StringTable.csv,St.Bernard,"Oh, that's a good'un.",
BVST053SB,BV_StringTable.csv,St.Bernard,Yep.,
BVST054SB,BV_StringTable.csv,St.Bernard,Got a lot of... undertones.,
BVST055SB,BV_StringTable.csv,St.Bernard,"I painted this one with my left hand, not sure if you can tell.",
BVST056SB,BV_StringTable.csv,St.Bernard,Pretty sure that's gonna go up in value pretty soon.,
BVST057SB,BV_StringTable.csv,St.Bernard,"Put this one in your front hall, maybe with a...",
BVST058SB,BV_StringTable.csv,St.Bernard,"...like a little bowl of dried... you know... leaves, what have you.",
BVST059SB,BV_StringTable.csv,St.Bernard,Looks real nice. Seen it at my aunt's house.,
BVST061SB,BV_StringTable.csv,St.Bernard,"Hey, what else can I get ya?",
BVST062SB,BV_StringTable.csv,St.Bernard,"You can't have too much art, can ya?",
BVST063SB,BV_StringTable.csv,St.Bernard,Hold on. Let me get my salesman thing going here...,
BVST064SB,BV_StringTable.csv,St.Bernard,Darn. I was hoping for a lady.,
BVST065SB,BV_StringTable.csv,St.Bernard,"Been a long time since I've painted a nice, fat lady.",
BVST066SB,BV_StringTable.csv,St.Bernard,Oh well! Hold that pose!,
BVTI000TI,BV_StringTable.csv,Tiger,"Wake up, little man, time to go nighty night.",
BVTI000RA,BV_StringTable.csv,Raz,I AM awake.,
BVTI001TI,BV_StringTable.csv,Tiger,"Good, because it is bedtime for you, snack-size.",
BVTI001RA,BV_StringTable.csv,Raz,What're you talking about?,
BVTI002TI,BV_StringTable.csv,Tiger,"You will fight me for my card, yes?",
BVTI002RA,BV_StringTable.csv,Raz,"Well, I AM looking for some cards.",
BVTI003TI,BV_StringTable.csv,Tiger,"Then, small fry, I am afraid the Sandman is going to have to bend way over to reach you because you are so awfully itty-bitty and then--",
BVTI003RA,BV_StringTable.csv,Raz,"All right, I get it.  Just shut up and let's go.",
BVTI007TI,BV_StringTable.csv,Tiger,"Then I will shut up, but only so I can enjoy the microscopic spectacle of your attempts to make me shut up.",
BVTR000TI,BV_StringTable.csv,Tiger,I am going to tear you tiny limb from tiny limb.,
BVTR001TI,BV_StringTable.csv,Tiger,"As you can see, I have not yet shut up.",
BVTR002TI,BV_StringTable.csv,Tiger,It looks like you will be the one who will be doing the shutting up.,
BVTR003TI,BV_StringTable.csv,Tiger,Sh-Shut up.,
BVWP000RA,BV_StringTable.csv,Raz,Alright! The Queen of Clubs! Now I have to give this to Edgar!,
BVWP001RA,BV_StringTable.csv,Raz,"Okay, I got the Queen of Hearts. Edgar will want this.",
BVWP002RA,BV_StringTable.csv,Raz,The Queen of Diamonds is all mine! Uh... until I give it to Edgar.,
BVWP003RA,BV_StringTable.csv,Raz,Hmmm. The Queen of Spades. I should get rid of this card quickly. It seems like bad luck.,
BVWP004RA,BV_StringTable.csv,Raz,All right. That's all four cards. Once I give the last one to Edgar he should be able to fix his tower.,
BVWP005RA,BV_StringTable.csv,Raz,"Ha! Sleep tight, kitty.",
BVWP006RA,BV_StringTable.csv,Raz,"Man, I can STILL smell that guy!",
BVWP007RA,BV_StringTable.csv,Raz,"No more ""ca-caws"" out of you, fatty.",
BVWP008RA,BV_StringTable.csv,Raz,"I beat you just like I did in high school, loser!",
BVWP009RA,BV_StringTable.csv,Raz,Wait... who am I?,
BVWP010RA,BV_StringTable.csv,Raz,Aaaaaaaaa-hfff!,
BVWS000RA,BV_StringTable.csv,Raz,Red roses. Works every time.,
BVWS001RA,BV_StringTable.csv,Raz,"Excuse me ma'am, but could I hide out in there with you? This bull is coming down the street...",
BVWS002RA,BV_StringTable.csv,Raz,Help! Let me in!,
BVWS003RA,BV_StringTable.csv,Raz,"Please, ma'am. Do not be afraid. Do I look dangerous to you?",
BVWS004RA,BV_StringTable.csv,Raz,Hmmm. Maybe if I could charm the lady behind those shutters somehow.,
BVWT003SB,BV_StringTable.csv,St.Bernard,"Oh, now you're lucky I got a gentle disposition.",
BVWT006SB,BV_StringTable.csv,St.Bernard,Arf!,
BVWT007SB,BV_StringTable.csv,St.Bernard,Yow!,
BVWT009CL,BV_StringTable.csv,Collie,Tsk! Everyone's a critic!,

BVWT015DA,BV_StringTable.csv,Dalmatian,"Owf, I deserve much worse than that for painting this stuff.",
BVWT022RA,BV_StringTable.csv,Raz,Snap out of it!,
BVWT023BD,BV_StringTable.csv,Bulldog,That doesn't help!,
BVWT025MA,BV_StringTable.csv,Matador,Ooh. Good thing you cannot reach my face. Then I'd be mad.,
BVWT027ED,BV_StringTable.csv,Edgar,Ahhh! Have you fallen in league with that infernal Bull?,
BVWT029RA,BV_StringTable.csv,Raz,That's strange.,
BVWT030RA,BV_StringTable.csv,Raz,I'm starting to feel like I'm back in high school.,
BVWT031RA,BV_StringTable.csv,Raz,"Which is weird, because I'm only ten.",
BVWT033RA,BV_StringTable.csv,Raz,Ca-caw.,

BVWU006EA,BV_StringTable.csv,Eagle,Ca-caw?,
BVWV008BD,BV_StringTable.csv,Bulldog,"Man, I can't take anymore. Why don't you confuse something else?",
BVWV010BD,BV_StringTable.csv,Bulldog,I think I built up a resistance to these things. Why don't you try it on the bull.,
BVWW002MA,BV_StringTable.csv,Matador,I do not have time for this nonsense.,
BVWW003MA,BV_StringTable.csv,Matador,You know what would look good in that frame? My reflection in a mirror.,
BVWW004MA,BV_StringTable.csv,Matador,"Are you going somewhere? Never mind, I don't care.",
BVWW005MA,BV_StringTable.csv,Matador,"You're an eight year old boy, so, regretfully, I must decline.",
BVWW006MA,BV_StringTable.csv,Matador,I can get those from my pet any time I want.,
BVWW007MA,BV_StringTable.csv,Matador,A crow feather? What are you thinking?,
BVWW008ED,BV_StringTable.csv,Edgar,Please stop wasting my time.,
BVWW009ED,BV_StringTable.csv,Edgar,The last thing I need is more art. Bring me those queens!,
BVWW010ED,BV_StringTable.csv,Edgar,"A playing card! No wait, what is that? Never mind, just bring me the queens!",
BVWW011ED,BV_StringTable.csv,Edgar,"Ah, the rose. Symbol of desire. Such as my desire for more queens. Stop wasting time!",
BVWW012ED,BV_StringTable.csv,Edgar,Stop bothering me with? What is that anyway?,
BVWW013ED,BV_StringTable.csv,Edgar,I'm interested in one thing: Queens.,
BVWW014SB,BV_StringTable.csv,St.Bernard,What made you think I'd be interested in this?,
BVWW015SB,BV_StringTable.csv,St.Bernard,"Sorry, buddy, all sales are final.",
