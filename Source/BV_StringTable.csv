BVDO005RA,BVDO,Raz,"Edgar, listen. There is no El Odio, no Lampita, no Dingo.",
BVDO006RA,BVDO,Raz,They are all just creations of your rage.,
BVDO007RA,BVDO,Raz,You have to let them go or they will torture you forever.,
BVDO008ED,BVDO,Edgar,Wha--,
BVDO009RA,BVDO,Raz,"That is your romanticized memory of your ex-girlfriend Lana Panzoni, who dumped you for Dean LaGrante way back in high school!",

BVDO032ED,BVDO,Edgar,"They stole my happiness, my life, the state semi finals, everything!",
BVDO033ED,BVDO,Edgar,Ahhhhhh!,
BVDO034RA,BVDO,Raz,"No, wait! Edgar!",
BVDO035LA,BVDO,Lampita,Olé!,
BVDO036DI,BVDO,Dingo,Ha ha ha! He never learns!,
BVDO037RA,BVDO,Raz,I guess I have to take this Matador out myself before he does too much damage.,
BVIN001RA,BVIN,Raz,That's an impressive house of cards you're building there.,
BVIN002ED,BVIN,Edgar,"And still... not high enough to reach the sky, and free her from her prison.",
BVIN003RA,BVIN,Raz,Who is she?,
BVIN004ED,BVIN,Edgar,I--I do not know.,
BVIN005ED,BVIN,Edgar,"I only know that she is beautiful, perfect, and sad.",
BVIN006ED,BVIN,Edgar,"All day she cries rose petal tears, and I can do nothing to help her because my creation... lacks something.",
BVIN007ED,BVIN,Edgar,And it will not stand against the bull.,
BVIN008RA,BVIN,Raz,What bull?,
BVIN009ED,BVIN,Edgar,El Odio.,
BVIN010RA,BVIN,Raz,"Okay, don't take this the wrong way, but I don't think you're working with a full deck here.",
BVIN011ED,BVIN,Edgar,"Somewhere along the way I feel that I lost something important, but I do not know",
BVIN012RA,BVIN,Raz,I think it's your queens. You want me to go look for them?,
BVIN013ED,BVIN,Edgar,Bring me any cards you find! I must complete this tower!,

BVOT003RA,BVOT,Raz,Kill who?,
BVOT005RA,BVOT,Raz,I didn't.,
BVOT006RA,BVOT,Raz,Edgar?,

BVVI006RA,BVVI,Raz,"Ug, please. Edgar, look at them. They're too pathetic to hurt you any more.",
BVVI007RA,BVVI,Raz,Can't you just let it go?,
BVVI008ED,BVVI,Edgar,How embarrassing. I can't believe I was hung up for so long over these losers.,
BVVI009LA,BVVI,Lampita,Um... uh... I--I always loved you more?,
BVVI010LA,BVVI,Lampita,Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!,

BVAM003RA,BVAM,Raz,"Hey, uh, we really gotta get that billboard painted.",
BVAM000BD,BVAM,Bulldog,"Okay, man, here's the plan. Step one: I quit ""we."" Step two: ""We""--which is now just you--runs out there and gets killed painting the billboard.",
BVAM004RA,BVAM,Raz,Maybe I can distract the bull while you paint. It's so crazy it just might work.,
BVAM001BD,BVAM,Bulldog,"Or maybe it's so crazy that it's just extra crazy. There's absolutely no way I'm going out there, man.",
BVAM005RA,BVAM,Raz,"C'mon, you're a bulldog! Show some backbone. Plus, who wants to go for a walk? Who wants to go for a walk?",
BVAM002BD,BVAM,Bulldog,"Stupid. Dog. Brain. RRRRRR. ACK. Alright, let's go!",

BVBI000BD,BVBI,Bulldog,NO! The painting's ruined!,
BVBI001BD,BVBI,Bulldog,"Oh, that's the biggest squirrel I've ever seen. Out of my way, kid!",
BVBM000RA,BVBM,Raz,You look pretty jumpy. What's the problem?,
BVBM002BD,BVBM,Bulldog,I'm supposed to paint an ad for the big fight between Dingo the Matador and the town bull. Only the bull's on a rampage right through where the painting needs to go.,
BVBM002RA,BVBM,Raz,"Oooo, Dingo the Matador? I need to talk to him!",
BVBM004BD,BVBM,Bulldog,"His apartment's right upstairs. While you're there, maybe you can convince him to take care of the bull.",

BVCI000CB,BVCI,Cobra,"Hey Edgar, nice headgear.  Freak.",
BVCI014RA,BVCI,Raz,What?,
BVCI001CB,BVCI,Cobra,"What? You suck, Teglee. You can't beat me. Coach says I can't be beat. Coach says I got mental toughness. You can't break my concentration, wimp.",
BVCI015RA,BVCI,Raz,"Hey, I'm not Edgar.",
BVCI002CB,BVCI,Cobra,"Yeah, you're gonna wish you're not Edgar when I'm through.",
BVCI016RA,BVCI,Raz,"Look, I am NOT Edgar Teglee.  My name's Raz.  I'm a Psychonaut.",
BVCI003CB,BVCI,Cobra,"You're an idiot, Smeglee. Coach says your psycho girl-crazy lack of focus cost you states.",
BVCI017RA,BVCI,Raz,"Seriously, I don't want to have to hurt you.",
BVCI004CB,BVCI,Cobra,"Well since you'd have to break my concentration to even touch me, and since you can't break my concentration, I guess you won't be too disappointed then.",
BVCO000CL,BVCO,Collie,What? I can't BELIEVE you're not buying that beautiful painting.,
BVCO001CL,BVCO,Collie,"Yes, I guess it's hard to look at just one when you're at a delicious smorgasbord such as this!",
BVCO002CL,BVCO,Collie,Hup. Where'd you go?,
BVCO003CL,BVCO,Collie,"Oh, this one's good too!",
BVCO004CL,BVCO,Collie,"Oh, there you are!",
BVCO000RA,BVCO,Raz,I'll take it!,
BVCO005CL,BVCO,Collie,(gasp),
BVCO006CL,BVCO,Collie,"Oh, I don't know if I can let it go!",
BVCO007CL,BVCO,Collie,Oh all right. If you're going to give me that puppy dog look!,
BVCO008CL,BVCO,Collie,"Okay, number one: I am an ARTIST. Don't speak to me of BUSINESS.",
BVCO009CL,BVCO,Collie,Number two: True beauty is priceless.,
BVCO010CL,BVCO,Collie,Number three: Yes. Come...,
BVCO011CL,BVCO,Collie,"Sorry but my priceless art has been sold off, cheap, much like the years of my youth.",
BVCO078CL,BVCO,Collie,"My priceless art has been sold off, cheap, much like the years of my youth.",
BVCO012CL,BVCO,Collie,Thank god. I felt like I was being looted.,
BVCO013CL,BVCO,Collie,(cough) Pearls before swine. (cough),
BVCO014CL,BVCO,Collie,Nothing.,
BVCO015CL,BVCO,Collie,"Now then, you will, of course, want something else.",
BVCO002RA,BVCO,Raz,"Hey, how's business? Can I buy some art?",
BVCO003RA,BVCO,Raz,"Yeah, I saw another dog selling art up the street. Are you guys a chain?",
BVCO004RA,BVCO,Raz,Why don't you guys just make a run for it?,
BVCO016RA,BVCO,Raz,Could you tell me again about your dog friends?,
BVCO005RA,BVCO,Raz,"Hey, can you fight bulls? I have a bull problem.",
BVCO006RA,BVCO,Raz,Who CAN do it? Who can fight El Odio?,
BVCO007RA,BVCO,Raz,Why won't they ask Dingo to help? Is he expensive?,
BVCO008RA,BVCO,Raz,WHAT? What happened between Dingo and Edgar?,
BVCO009RA,BVCO,Raz,COME ON! Tell me! What's the big scandal???,
BVCO011RA,BVCO,Raz,"Okay, I bought some art. Now give me the dirt on Dingo.",
BVCO012RA,BVCO,Raz,Whoa. That's a great story. You should do a painting about it.,
BVCO013RA,BVCO,Raz,I think that Dingo sounds like a jerk.,
BVCO014RA,BVCO,Raz,Must be tough.,
BVCO015RA,BVCO,Raz,Gotta go.,
BVCO077CL,BVCO,Collie,"Shoo, get out of here.  Don't bother my customers!",
BVCO016CL,BVCO,Collie,"Ah, you have met my compadres. When we were young art dogs we would run wild in the street together.",
BVCO017CL,BVCO,Collie,But now...,
BVCO018CL,BVCO,Collie,You couldn't understand.,
BVCO019CL,BVCO,Collie,El Odio imprisons us all. Art is the only escape.,
BVCO020CL,BVCO,Collie,And today is the only day...,
BVCO021CL,BVCO,Collie,...that it's going to be this cheap. All these prices go up tomorrow because of tourist season.,
BVCO022CL,BVCO,Collie,Sorry.,
BVCO023CL,BVCO,Collie,Artist here.,
BVCO024CL,BVCO,Collie,Delicate hands.,
BVCO025CL,BVCO,Collie,"And anyway, if you are talking about El Odio, well...",
BVCO026CL,BVCO,Collie,"There is, of course, only one man who could handle that much bull.",
BVCO027CL,BVCO,Collie,I speak of no other than Dingo Inflagrante...,
BVCO028CL,BVCO,Collie,...the infamous Matador playboy.,
BVCO029CL,BVCO,Collie,"Alas, they would never ask him to help. Not in a million years!",
BVCO030CL,BVCO,Collie,No. Because of what happened between him and Edgar. Quite a scandal.,
BVCO031CL,BVCO,Collie,Tragedy. Betrayal.,
BVCO032CL,BVCO,Collie,Art.,
BVCO033CL,BVCO,Collie,Love.,
BVCO034CL,BVCO,Collie,Pain.,
BVCO035CL,BVCO,Collie,Nothing you want to know about.,
BVCO036CL,BVCO,Collie,"Listen, I deal in truth and beauty, not dirt.",
BVCO037CL,BVCO,Collie,But...,
BVCO038CL,BVCO,Collie,Maybe if you had bought some art...,
BVCO039CL,BVCO,Collie,"...then I'd have to come up with some small talk while we're making change, and, you know",
BVCO040CL,BVCO,Collie,Mmmm...hmmhmmm...,
BVCO041CL,BVCO,Collie,"Okay, here's how I heard it.",
BVCO042CL,BVCO,Collie,"Years ago, when Edgar was a world-renowned painter, he was commissioned by Dingo to immortalize him in black velvet.",
BVCO043CL,BVCO,Collie,"But while he was sitting for the portrait, Dingo met Edgar's beautiful wife.",
BVCO044CL,BVCO,Collie,Who was none other than the top Flamenco dancer Lampita Pasionado!,
BVCO045CL,BVCO,Collie,"He seduced the dancer, and the two ran off together, leaving Edgar with the unfinished painting...",
BVCO046CL,BVCO,Collie,...and a broken heart.,
BVCO047CL,BVCO,Collie,"Since then, Edgar thinks of nothing but the treacherous pair...",
BVCO048CL,BVCO,Collie,...and since then our streets have been ruled by...,
BVCO049CL,BVCO,Collie,...El Odio!,
BVCO050CL,BVCO,Collie,"Yes, that's what we need around here. Some paintings of Dingo and bulls, yeah. Good idea.",
BVCO051CL,BVCO,Collie,"Ah, he gets an unfair rap because of his looks.",
BVCO052CL,BVCO,Collie,"As a Collie, I know how hard it is to be resented for your beauty.",
BVCO053CL,BVCO,Collie,It's like being forced to wear a golden robe with a diamond 'kick me' sign on the back.,
BVCO054CL,BVCO,Collie,Eh. I work it out through my painting.,
BVCO055CL,BVCO,Collie,Be good.,
BVCO056CL,BVCO,Collie,"Since I am trapped here, I like to paint far away island scenes as an escape.",
BVCO057CL,BVCO,Collie,Like this adorable tiki hut.,
BVCO058CL,BVCO,Collie,Do you think tiki is a fun word to say? I do.,
BVCO059CL,BVCO,Collie,I love this painting.,
BVCO060CL,BVCO,Collie,Look at the brushwork!,
BVCO061CL,BVCO,Collie,"I love it so much, if it didn't have it's backside up against the wall, I would sniff it!",
BVCO062CL,BVCO,Collie,"Yes. A thing of beauty is a joy forever, but... prices like these cannot last.",
BVCO063CL,BVCO,Collie,Now that I look at it... I'm not sure if it's for sale at all. It might be too good. I might have to keep it.,
BVCO064CL,BVCO,Collie,"It's almost as beautiful as me, you have to admit.",
BVCO065CL,BVCO,Collie,Please don't breathe directly on this painting. It is very valuable.,
BVCO066CL,BVCO,Collie,"I cannot look at this painting for too long, or I will cry with joy.",
BVCO067CL,BVCO,Collie,Outstanding. That's all I can say.,
BVCO068CL,BVCO,Collie,"No offense, but you are not good enough for this piece. Please, please do not buy it.",
BVCO069CL,BVCO,Collie,I was playing with spatial relationships here.,
BVCO070CL,BVCO,Collie,"Well, I 'played' in the same way that Beethoven 'played' with dissonance in the 'Eroica Symphony, if you follow me.",
BVCO071CL,BVCO,Collie,This one is... well... more of a tone poem.,
BVCO072CL,BVCO,Collie,"What's important in this piece is not what I painted, but what I did NOT paint. Know what I mean?",
BVCO073CL,BVCO,Collie,"Well, I guess I COULD let this one go...",
BVCO074CL,BVCO,Collie,Try to handle it only by the edges.,
BVCO076CL,BVCO,Collie,Step into my world of beauty.,
BVCP016RA,BVCP,Raz,Tell me that story about Dingo and Lampita again!,
BVCR000CB,BVCR,Cobra,"You can't hurt me, Smeglee!",
BVCR000RA,BVCR,Raz,"Look, mister, I AM NOT EDGAR TEGLEE!",
BVDA082DA,BVDA,Dalmatian,Get outta here you punks!  Leave my customer alone!,
BVDA000DA,BVDA,Dalmatian,What? You want more?,
BVDA001DA,BVDA,Dalmatian,"Ha-huh.  Couldn't look at that one any more, ahh?",
BVDA002DA,BVDA,Dalmatian,"Look, give it up. None of them are any good.",
BVDA003DA,BVDA,Dalmatian,Each one worse than the last...,
BVDA004DA,BVDA,Dalmatian,You're kidding.,
BVDA001RA,BVDA,Raz,"No, I want it.",
BVDA005DA,BVDA,Dalmatian,"Well, there's no accounting for taste I guess.",
BVDA006DA,BVDA,Dalmatian,Right this way!,
BVDA007DA,BVDA,Dalmatian,Sorry. I'm sold out.,
BVDA008DA,BVDA,Dalmatian,"Oh, wait. To be honest, I'm NOT sorry about that. I am happy about that.",
BVDA009DA,BVDA,Dalmatian,"You bought it all so YOU are the sorry one, my friend.",
BVDA010DA,BVDA,Dalmatian,"Don't tell anyone who painted these, okay?",
BVDA014DA,BVDA,Dalmatian,Goooood riddance!,
BVDA012DA,BVDA,Dalmatian,"Well, maybe you can write it off on your taxes as a loss.",
BVDA013DA,BVDA,Dalmatian,"A catastrophic loss, even.",
BVDA015DA,BVDA,Dalmatian,Enjoy that!   Heeheeeheee.,
BVDA016DA,BVDA,Dalmatian,"Well, with some luck, and a lot of self-abuse on your part, I have managed to sell out.",
BVDA017DA,BVDA,Dalmatian,My thanks to your poor judgment.,
BVDA002RA,BVDA,Raz,Hi. I want to buy a painting,
BVDA003RA,BVDA,Raz,"No, really. I'd like some art.",
BVDA004RA,BVDA,Raz,You're going to turn away a paying customer?,
BVDA005RA,BVDA,Raz,"Edgar Teglee sent me. You know, the famous painter? How about a discount?",
BVDA006RA,BVDA,Raz,"Pfft, you don't give discounts? Or pffft, you don't think he's famous?",
BVDA007RA,BVDA,Raz,"Hey, there's no shame in hiding from wrestlers. They're trouble. Especially the wild animal type.",
BVDA008RA,BVDA,Raz,No. I just meant wrestlers can be tough. I didn't mean you.,
BVDA009RA,BVDA,Raz,Yes. I would like to wrestle. Let's go.,
BVDA010RA,BVDA,Raz,"Yeah, I want some art.",
BVDA011RA,BVDA,Raz,"No, I want to talk about Edgar. Has he always had a problem with wrestlers?",
BVDA012RA,BVDA,Raz,Has Edgar always had a problem with wrestlers?,
BVDA013RA,BVDA,Raz,Why did he choke? Did they get him in one of those pile driver things?,
BVDA014RA,BVDA,Raz,How sad. Especially since it all happened to him again with Dingo and Lampita.,
BVDA016RA,BVDA,Raz,So tell me that again? Edgar was a bad wrestler?,
BVDA015RA,BVDA,Raz,See ya.,
BVDA044DA,BVDA,Dalmatian,No you don't.,
BVDA045DA,BVDA,Dalmatian,Came to the wrong place then. All we got here is junk.,
BVDA046DA,BVDA,Dalmatian,Hm. Your argument has many strong points.,
BVDA047DA,BVDA,Dalmatian,Especially around that area where you said the word paying,
BVDA048DA,BVDA,Dalmatian,I liked that.,
BVDA050DA,BVDA,Dalmatian,"Well, I guess it might cheer up the joint to get rid of some of these eyesores outta here.",
BVDA051DA,BVDA,Dalmatian,"Come on, I'll give you a tour of the atrocities. I just hope you got a strong stomach.",
BVDA018DA,BVDA,Dalmatian,Famous painter? Edgar?,
BVDA019DA,BVDA,Dalmatian,"Pffft! Yeah, right!",
BVDA020DA,BVDA,Dalmatian,"Look, I'm sorry, but eating lunch every day in the art teacher's room does not make you a famous painter.",
BVDA021DA,BVDA,Dalmatian,"Anyway, he only did that to hide out from the school wrestling team.",
BVDA022DA,BVDA,Dalmatian,"Oh, whaddya mean wild animals? Like dogs, eh?",
BVDA023DA,BVDA,Dalmatian,"Oh, you got a problem with me now?",
BVDA024DA,BVDA,Dalmatian,"Oh, you don't think I'm tough now?",
BVDA025DA,BVDA,Dalmatian,"Why, 'cause I'm a Dalmatian?",
BVDA026DA,BVDA,Dalmatian,"Hey, we can't all be St. Bernards and Bulldogs, you know!",
BVDA027DA,BVDA,Dalmatian,(Sigh.),
BVDA028DA,BVDA,Dalmatian,"Look, man. Are you gonna buy something or what?",
BVDA029DA,BVDA,Dalmatian,"No way. In fact, he used to be the captain of his high school wrestling team!",
BVDA030DA,BVDA,Dalmatian,"He took them all the way to the state semi-finals one year, and then he...",
BVDA031DA,BVDA,Dalmatian,...he choked.,
BVDA032DA,BVDA,Dalmatian,Cost the team the entire match.,
BVDA034DA,BVDA,Dalmatian,"No, Edgar's girlfriend Lana Panzoni dumped him after the first period for Dean Legrante, the head of her cheerleading squad.",
BVDA035DA,BVDA,Dalmatian,Teglee was worthless after that.,
BVDA036DA,BVDA,Dalmatian,The other team just tossed him around the rest of the day like a half sack of pork rinds.,
BVDA037DA,BVDA,Dalmatian,"Oh, man. His squad hated him after that. The whole school did.",
BVDA038DA,BVDA,Dalmatian,Ohhhhhhh. Riiigggght.,
BVDA039DA,BVDA,Dalmatian,"Yeah, they exist.",
BVDA040DA,BVDA,Dalmatian,"Not made up at all, those two.",
BVDA041DA,BVDA,Dalmatian,Sheesh.,
BVDA042DA,BVDA,Dalmatian,"Hey, I got some original Picassos over here if you're interested, by the way...",
BVDA043DA,BVDA,Dalmatian,"Yes, run! Run from the horror!",
BVDA049DA,BVDA,Dalmatian,Thanks.,
BVDA052DA,BVDA,Dalmatian,"Hey, I can call it that. You can't.",
BVDA053DA,BVDA,Dalmatian,"Well, not until you pay for it at least.",
BVDA054DA,BVDA,Dalmatian,Okay what I was going for here was a creeping vine. The kind that grows up walls?,
BVDA055DA,BVDA,Dalmatian,But it just ended up looking like a truck driver's hairy back.,
BVDA056DA,BVDA,Dalmatian,But without the charisma.,
BVDA057DA,BVDA,Dalmatian,"This, believe it or not, is supposed to be a rose.",
BVDA058DA,BVDA,Dalmatian,"You know, if you gave a woman a rose that looked like this, she'd slap you.",
BVDA059DA,BVDA,Dalmatian,Ya see what I'm talking about?,
BVDA060DA,BVDA,Dalmatian,This stuff reeks.,
BVDA061DA,BVDA,Dalmatian,Ew.,
BVDA062DA,BVDA,Dalmatian,"I recommend you don't look directly at this one. It is so awful, you could mess up your eyes.",
BVDA063DA,BVDA,Dalmatian,"Ewww, so bad...",
BVDA064DA,BVDA,Dalmatian,Whoa! I forgot how crummy this one was.,
BVDA065DA,BVDA,Dalmatian,I can't believe I painted this.,
BVDA066DA,BVDA,Dalmatian,Ach!,
BVDA067DA,BVDA,Dalmatian,"This one is so bad, someone should take a rolled-up newspaper and smack it.",
BVDA068DA,BVDA,Dalmatian,Seriously. What a load.,
BVDA069DA,BVDA,Dalmatian,This looks like electric clown barf in space.,
BVDA070DA,BVDA,Dalmatian,Terrible!,
BVDA071DA,BVDA,Dalmatian,"Uhhh, uhhh I'm sorry you had to see this.",
BVDA072DA,BVDA,Dalmatian,Ug.,
BVDA073DA,BVDA,Dalmatian,I deserve to get my nose rubbed in this one.,
BVDA074DA,BVDA,Dalmatian,This painting reminds me of my grandpa's last year alive...,
BVDA075DA,BVDA,Dalmatian,...just one terrible stroke on top of another.,
BVDA076DA,BVDA,Dalmatian,"Really, I should just take this one out back and bury it.",
BVDA077DA,BVDA,Dalmatian,Ech! Somebody light a match! This one really stinks.,
BVDA078DA,BVDA,Dalmatian,Woof! That's all I gotta say about that.,
BVDA079DA,BVDA,Dalmatian,Black velvet hasn't been abused like this since the last time Mom got drunk in her prom dress.,
BVDA080DA,BVDA,Dalmatian,Just awful!,
BVDA081DA,BVDA,Dalmatian,Bleech!,
BVDI008RA,BVDI,Raz,Yow. What's that smell?,
BVDI000DR,BVDI,Dragon,"That smells like fear, boy!",
BVDI009RA,BVDI,Raz,"Yeah... No, I mean that fart smell.",
BVDI001DR,BVDI,Dragon,That's fear! RAWRRRR!,
BVDI010RA,BVDI,Raz,"No, I'm talking about an actual smell. It's like if stink bombs laid eggs and then those went bad.",
BVDI002DR,BVDI,Dragon,"That's sulfur. It's part of the dragon costume, kid.",
BVED000ED,BVED,Edgar,"If you are curious about the load-bearing capacity of cardhouses, please conduct your experiments on SOMEONE ELSE'S HOUSE OF CARDS!",
BVED001ED,BVED,Edgar,"The cards are large, yes, but it is still a house of cards. KEEP OFF!",
BVED002ED,BVED,Edgar,"Jumping on the house of cards, stumbling into the house of cards, driving your glowing ball through the house of cards: none of these activities help me.",
BVED003ED,BVED,Edgar,"Please, boy, I must have those queens!",
BVED004ED,BVED,Edgar,Perfect! One step closer... to her.,
BVED005ED,BVED,Edgar,"Ah, that is exactly the card I need!",
BVED000RA,BVED,Raz,"Wow. It looks like you can walk right up there now, Edgar.",
BVED004RA,BVED,Raz,"Here you go, Edgar.",
BVED005RA,BVED,Raz,"I got some cards for you, Edgar.",
BVED006RA,BVED,Raz,This one was a real pain in the butt to get.,
BVED007RA,BVED,Raz,"I hope these things are worth it, Edgar.",
BVEI000EA,BVEI,Eagle,Ca-caw.,
BVEI013RA,BVEI,Raz,That's it? Ca--MAN! That's ss-,
BVEI001EA,BVEI,Eagle,Ca-caw. Ca-caw.,
BVEQ002ED,BVEQ,Edgar,Thank you! I'll take any other cards you have as well.,
BVHO000RA,BVHO,Raz,Now that looks like a good place to hang a painting!,
BVMB000BD,BVMB,Bulldog,"Oh my god, I'm deaf!",
BVMB012RA,BVMB,Raz,Can you hear me? You're getting sleepy.  But not too sleepy to go paint the billboard.,
BVMB002BD,BVMB,Bulldog,"What? Oh my god. Hey, ""god"" is ""dog"" spelled backwards!",
BVMB003BD,BVMB,Bulldog,"Whoa, whoa wait a minute. ""God"" is ""cat"" spelled backwards! Oh no. No no no no no.",
BVMB004BD,BVMB,Bulldog,I'm shaving just like daddy!,
BVMB013RA,BVMB,Raz,I think I solved your problem. Watch this.,
BVMB000MA,BVMB,Matador,"I had my doubts, but--",
BVMB001MA,BVMB,Matador,"But I'm right as usual. Really nice job, genius. Now go back out there and finish the job.",
BVMI002MA,BVMI,Matador,"Ah, the towel boy.  Oh, it's you.  Get out.",
BVMI001MA,BVMI,Matador,I see the sign's not finished. That's what I get for trusting a bullfight to an eight year old.,
BVMO000MA,BVMO,Matador,Hmmm. It's not great.,
BVMO001MA,BVMO,Matador,But I suppose it's just barely good enough. Come see me if you still want your reward.,
BVMO000RA,BVMO,Raz,"You know, your advice didn't work.",
BVMO002MA,BVMO,Matador,Really? Then here's some new advice: I don't know what you're talking about.,
BVMO001RA,BVMO,Raz,How about that reward?,
BVMO003MA,BVMO,Matador,"Fine, then. One autograph.",
BVMP005MA,BVMP,Matador,"Ah, you must be the towel boy!",
BVMP008MA,BVMP,Matador,You want an autograph? I don't just hand those out.,
BVMP009MA,BVMP,Matador,And that's a good lesson for you: anticipate disappointment. Take me: I'm the greatest bullfighter who's ever lived. Yet my upcoming match against the town bull has received virtually no marketing support.,
BVMP010MA,BVMP,Matador,"A towering advertisement was supposed to have been painted just outside my window. But, as you can see, the job hasn't even been started.",
BVMP005RA,BVMP,Raz,I think that bull is trampling anyone who tries to paint on the wall. Maybe you could stop it.,
BVMP011MA,BVMP,Matador,"Hmmm ...  so instead of challenging the bull before a stadium packed with screaming women, you want me to fight it on the street in front of one dog and one child wearing a crude towel boy disguise. That's a terrible idea.",
BVRO005RA,BVRO,Raz,"I should find a proper hook for this painting, so it will come to life like that dog said.",
BVRO000RA,BVRO,Raz,I should give this rose to someone who'd appreciate it.,
BVRO001RA,BVRO,Raz,I'll bet there's a lonely lady out there somewhere who could use a little cheering up.,
BVRO002RA,BVRO,Raz,Maybe one of those ladies hiding behind the shutters?,
BVST010RA,BVST,Raz,"Hey, have you seen any REALLY BIG playing cards around here?",
BVST012RA,BVST,Raz,I'd like to buy some more art.,
BVST000SB,BVST,St.Bernard,"No? Uh, okay.",
BVST001SB,BVST,St.Bernard,Where'd ya go?,
BVST003SB,BVST,St.Bernard,Moving right along...,
BVST004SB,BVST,St.Bernard,"Yeah, yeah. Check 'em all out of course. I got nowhere to go.",
BVST005SB,BVST,St.Bernard,What? You don't say?,
BVST006SB,BVST,St.Bernard,Heck! Alright then!,
BVST007SB,BVST,St.Bernard,"Really? Uh, uh, sure!",
BVST008SB,BVST,St.Bernard,"Hold on. Uh, let me get my salesman thing going here...",
BVST009SB,BVST,St.Bernard,"I'd love to, but I'm all sold out!",
BVST010SB,BVST,St.Bernard,I guess my rep WAS right. This IS my year!,
BVST068SB,BVST,St.Bernard,I'm all sold out!,
BVST012SB,BVST,St.Bernard,Enjoy your new art there!,
BVST013SB,BVST,St.Bernard,"You hang that in just the right spot, I promise you it will really come to life for ya!",
BVST011SB,BVST,St.Bernard,"Oh, ok.",
BVST016SB,BVST,St.Bernard,Struck out again.,
BVST017SB,BVST,St.Bernard,Is it my painting? My salesmanship? Me?,
BVST018SB,BVST,St.Bernard,"Good, good, good.  There you go!",
BVST019SB,BVST,St.Bernard,"You want, like, a ribbon around that or something?  No?  Okay.",
BVST020SB,BVST,St.Bernard,Made a good choice there I think.,
BVST001RA,BVST,Raz,"Hey, can I buy some art?",
BVST003RA,BVST,Raz,I think I hate that bull a lot.,
BVST004RA,BVST,Raz,Hi. Could you please paint me a big gun please?,
BVST005RA,BVST,Raz,"Okay, I'm off.",
BVST006RA,BVST,Raz,"Uh-huh. So, the cards? You know where they are?",
BVST007RA,BVST,Raz,Those are exactly the cards I need! Where are they?,
BVST011RA,BVST,Raz,Where did you say those cards were again?,
BVST008RA,BVST,Raz,What do you mean trapped? Are you a prisoner of art just like Edgar?,
BVST009RA,BVST,Raz,"Okay, promise me you won't take this the wrong way, but you ARE a dog.",
BVST021SB,BVST,St.Bernard,"Oh, man. I wish.  That would solve that would solve a lot of my problems.",
BVST022SB,BVST,St.Bernard,But no this is everything I know how to paint right here.,
BVST023SB,BVST,St.Bernard,"Man, that's embarrassing...",
BVST024SB,BVST,St.Bernard,"Now that takes me back. Poker night with the guys... Man, I miss those dogs.",
BVST025SB,BVST,St.Bernard,"Oh, right. Well, I do know about these four lost queens...",
BVST026SB,BVST,St.Bernard,"But that's all. Can't do much with four queens, can ya?",
BVST027SB,BVST,St.Bernard,Forget about it! They're guarded by some pretty nasty characters. Not to mention El Odio.,
BVST028SB,BVST,St.Bernard,You're better off just hanging out here and turning your head just a teensy bit to the left.,
BVST029SB,BVST,St.Bernard,"Oh, trust me. You'll hate him even more as time goes by. When he first trapped me in this alley, I thought he was only mildly annoying.",
BVST030SB,BVST,St.Bernard,I'm a prisoner of that stupid bull!,
BVST031SB,BVST,St.Bernard,"I don't wanna get gored, so I hide out in the alley, like a...",
BVST032SB,BVST,St.Bernard,...like a low-down dog!,
BVST033SB,BVST,St.Bernard,"Yeah but I'm a SAINT BERNARD, man!",
BVST034SB,BVST,St.Bernard,"I should be up in the highlands, above the tree line!",
BVST035SB,BVST,St.Bernard,Keg of brandy around my friggin' neck! Seeing the world!,
BVST036SB,BVST,St.Bernard,And finding more things to paint than this junk.,
BVST037SB,BVST,St.Bernard,Which is all for sale by the way.,
BVST038SB,BVST,St.Bernard,"Well, see ya. Keep off the street now.",
BVST039SB,BVST,St.Bernard,Ahem.,
BVST040SB,BVST,St.Bernard,"Ah, the guitar. Mysterious and musical and...",
BVST041SB,BVST,St.Bernard,"...blue. Look at it there, with it's",
BVST042SB,BVST,St.Bernard,With it's strings. Uh,
BVST043SB,BVST,St.Bernard,"Nothing woos the ladies quite like a guitar, am I right?",
BVST044SB,BVST,St.Bernard,(Am I? I really can't remember. Been in this alley a long time.),
BVST045SB,BVST,St.Bernard,"Anyway, how about it? Eh? Guitar? Yeah?",
BVST046SB,BVST,St.Bernard,I'll make ya a special deal.,
BVST047SB,BVST,St.Bernard,"Yes, yes. Uhh, the rose...",
BVST048SB,BVST,St.Bernard,Timeless symbol of the... of the... flower...,
BVST049SB,BVST,St.Bernard,...of love...,
BVST050SB,BVST,St.Bernard,"Um... romance, and uh...",
BVST051SB,BVST,St.Bernard,This one's real cheap.,
BVST052SB,BVST,St.Bernard,"Oh, that's a good'un.",
BVST053SB,BVST,St.Bernard,Yep.,
BVST054SB,BVST,St.Bernard,Got a lot of... undertones.,
BVST055SB,BVST,St.Bernard,"I painted this one with my left hand, not sure if you can tell.",
BVST056SB,BVST,St.Bernard,Pretty sure that's gonna go up in value pretty soon.,
BVST057SB,BVST,St.Bernard,"Put this one in your front hall, maybe with a...",
BVST058SB,BVST,St.Bernard,"...like a little bowl of dried... you know... leaves, what have you.",
BVST059SB,BVST,St.Bernard,Looks real nice. Seen it at my aunt's house.,
BVST061SB,BVST,St.Bernard,"Hey, what else can I get ya?",
BVST062SB,BVST,St.Bernard,"You can't have too much art, can ya?",
BVST063SB,BVST,St.Bernard,Hold on. Let me get my salesman thing going here...,
BVST064SB,BVST,St.Bernard,Darn. I was hoping for a lady.,
BVST065SB,BVST,St.Bernard,"Been a long time since I've painted a nice, fat lady.",
BVST066SB,BVST,St.Bernard,Oh well! Hold that pose!,
BVTI000TI,BVTI,Tiger,"Wake up, little man, time to go nighty night.",
BVTI000RA,BVTI,Raz,I AM awake.,
BVTI001TI,BVTI,Tiger,"Good, because it is bedtime for you, snack-size.",
BVTI001RA,BVTI,Raz,What're you talking about?,
BVTI002TI,BVTI,Tiger,"You will fight me for my card, yes?",
BVTI002RA,BVTI,Raz,"Well, I AM looking for some cards.",
BVTI003TI,BVTI,Tiger,"Then, small fry, I am afraid the Sandman is going to have to bend way over to reach you because you are so awfully itty-bitty and then--",
BVTI003RA,BVTI,Raz,"All right, I get it.  Just shut up and let's go.",
BVTI007TI,BVTI,Tiger,"Then I will shut up, but only so I can enjoy the microscopic spectacle of your attempts to make me shut up.",
BVTR000TI,BVTR,Tiger,I am going to tear you tiny limb from tiny limb.,
BVTR001TI,BVTR,Tiger,"As you can see, I have not yet shut up.",
BVTR002TI,BVTR,Tiger,It looks like you will be the one who will be doing the shutting up.,
BVTR003TI,BVTR,Tiger,Sh-Shut up.,
BVWP000RA,BVWP,Raz,Alright! The Queen of Clubs! Now I have to give this to Edgar!,
BVWP001RA,BVWP,Raz,"Okay, I got the Queen of Hearts. Edgar will want this.",
BVWP002RA,BVWP,Raz,The Queen of Diamonds is all mine! Uh... until I give it to Edgar.,
BVWP003RA,BVWP,Raz,Hmmm. The Queen of Spades. I should get rid of this card quickly. It seems like bad luck.,
BVWP004RA,BVWP,Raz,All right. That's all four cards. Once I give the last one to Edgar he should be able to fix his tower.,
BVWP005RA,BVWP,Raz,"Ha! Sleep tight, kitty.",
BVWP006RA,BVWP,Raz,"Man, I can STILL smell that guy!",
BVWP007RA,BVWP,Raz,"No more ""ca-caws"" out of you, fatty.",
BVWP008RA,BVWP,Raz,"I beat you just like I did in high school, loser!",
BVWP009RA,BVWP,Raz,Wait... who am I?,
BVWP010RA,BVWP,Raz,Aaaaaaaaa-hfff!,
BVWS000RA,BVWS,Raz,Red roses. Works every time.,
BVWS001RA,BVWS,Raz,"Excuse me ma'am, but could I hide out in there with you? This bull is coming down the street...",
BVWS002RA,BVWS,Raz,Help! Let me in!,
BVWS003RA,BVWS,Raz,"Please, ma'am. Do not be afraid. Do I look dangerous to you?",
BVWS004RA,BVWS,Raz,Hmmm. Maybe if I could charm the lady behind those shutters somehow.,
BVWT003SB,BVWT,St.Bernard,"Oh, now you're lucky I got a gentle disposition.",
BVWT006SB,BVWT,St.Bernard,Arf!,
BVWT007SB,BVWT,St.Bernard,Yow!,
BVWT009CL,BVWT,Collie,Tsk! Everyone's a critic!,
BVWT011CL,BVWT,Collie,Ooof!,
BVWT015DA,BVWT,Dalmatian,"Owf, I deserve much worse than that for painting this stuff.",
BVWT022RA,BVWT,Raz,Snap out of it!,
BVWT023BD,BVWT,Bulldog,That doesn't help!,
BVWT025MA,BVWT,Matador,Ooh. Good thing you cannot reach my face. Then I'd be mad.,
BVWT027ED,BVWT,Edgar,Ahhh! Have you fallen in league with that infernal Bull?,
BVWT029RA,BVWT,Raz,That's strange.,
BVWT030RA,BVWT,Raz,I'm starting to feel like I'm back in high school.,
BVWT031RA,BVWT,Raz,"Which is weird, because I'm only ten.",
BVWT033RA,BVWT,Raz,Ca-caw.,
BVWT035RA,BVWT,Raz,"Soon they'll be ""Dragon"" your ass outta here! Ha ha.",
BVWT036RA,BVWT,Raz,"Hey, are you awake? Did you hear that?",
BVWU002CB,BVWU,Cobra,"Where'd you go, Smeglee?",
BVWU003DR,BVWU,Dragon,"Ohh-hoh-hoh... you can run, coward, but you cannot hide!",
BVWU004TI,BVWU,Tiger,"You are so tiny, I cannot even see you anymore.",
BVWU006EA,BVWU,Eagle,Ca-caw?,
BVWV008BD,BVWV,Bulldog,"Man, I can't take anymore. Why don't you confuse something else?",
BVWV010BD,BVWV,Bulldog,I think I built up a resistance to these things. Why don't you try it on the bull.,
BVWW002MA,BVWW,Matador,I do not have time for this nonsense.,
BVWW003MA,BVWW,Matador,You know what would look good in that frame? My reflection in a mirror.,
BVWW004MA,BVWW,Matador,"Are you going somewhere? Never mind, I don't care.",
BVWW005MA,BVWW,Matador,"You're an eight year old boy, so, regretfully, I must decline.",
BVWW006MA,BVWW,Matador,I can get those from my pet any time I want.,
BVWW007MA,BVWW,Matador,A crow feather? What are you thinking?,
BVWW008ED,BVWW,Edgar,Please stop wasting my time.,
BVWW009ED,BVWW,Edgar,The last thing I need is more art. Bring me those queens!,
BVWW010ED,BVWW,Edgar,"A playing card! No wait, what is that? Never mind, just bring me the queens!",
BVWW011ED,BVWW,Edgar,"Ah, the rose. Symbol of desire. Such as my desire for more queens. Stop wasting time!",
BVWW012ED,BVWW,Edgar,Stop bothering me with? What is that anyway?,
BVWW013ED,BVWW,Edgar,I'm interested in one thing: Queens.,
BVWW014SB,BVWW,St.Bernard,What made you think I'd be interested in this?,
BVWW015SB,BVWW,St.Bernard,"Sorry, buddy, all sales are final.",
BVWW016SB,BVWW,St.Bernard,"Sorry, I don't deal in found art.",
BVWW017SB,BVWW,St.Bernard,"Touching, but I'm not interested.",
BVWW018CL,BVWW,Collie,"Ah, that's exquisitely not interesting to me.",
BVWW019CL,BVWW,Collie,"Luggage? I'm afraid we're all trapped here, my dear young optimist.",
BVWW020CL,BVWW,Collie,"I am a mammal, so you're close. But perhaps you should save that for someone of your own species.",
BVWW021CL,BVWW,Collie,"Sniff each others bums and eat our own sick, yes of course, but not all of us are interested in poker.",
BVWW022CL,BVWW,Collie,"What a curious thing! Though, oddly, I'm not curious about it in the least.",
BVWW023CL,BVWW,Collie,"If you find the bird that belongs to that feather, be a good lad and just stuff it right into my mouth.",
BVWW024DA,BVWW,Dalmatian,"Look, I'm not interested in your junk.",
BVWW025DA,BVWW,Dalmatian,This ain't the Bad Art Mutual Appreciation Society. Get out of here with that awful thing.,
BVWW026DA,BVWW,Dalmatian,That would be a striking comment on man's eternal struggle against luggage. If man had an eternal struggle against luggage.,
BVWW027DA,BVWW,Dalmatian,"You do realize I'm a boy dog, right? I'm just askin'.",
BVWW028BD,BVWW,Bulldog,"What am I supposed to do with that, man?",
BVWW029BD,BVWW,Bulldog,"I dispense the art, man. I don't receive it.",
BVWW030BD,BVWW,Bulldog,"Oh... ah... if you really loved me, you'd give me some raw hamburger.",
BVWW031RA,BVWW,Raz,I think he's in no condition to do anything with this stuff.,
BVWW032CB,BVWW,Cobra,"Bribes aren't gonna make me hurt you any less, Smeglee.",
BVWW033CB,BVWW,Cobra,Nice picture. Now put it away or people are gonna have to x-ray your colon to look at it.,
BVWW034CB,BVWW,Cobra,"When they bag you up, I'm sure the paramedics'll appreciate that you brought your own toe tag.",
BVWW035CB,BVWW,Cobra,"Oh, yeah, sweetheart. You're really dead now.",
BVWW036DR,BVWW,Dragon,Is this some kind of trick?,
BVWW037DR,BVWW,Dragon,Did you paint this? Let's find out if it's more valuable when you're dead.,
BVWW038DR,BVWW,Dragon,I see you're going on a trip. Destination: FEAR!,
BVWW039DR,BVWW,Dragon,"Ah, the sweet smell of FE--wait a minute, are you trying to give me a flower?",
BVWW040EA,BVWW,Eagle,Ca-caw,
BVWW041TI,BVWW,Tiger,"Show and tell is over, little man, now it's NAPTIME!",
BVWW042TI,BVWW,Tiger,AHHH! Your foul art is more painful than your teensy fists!,
BVWW043TI,BVWW,Tiger,"Good thing you packed a bag, because I am going to punch you into next week. Haha-haha. Time out! I cracked myself up.",
BVWW044RA,BVWW,Raz,"Hey, you? thing. Check this out? Not interested, eh?",
BVWW045RA,BVWW,Raz,"I don't even know what this thing is, much less if it likes art.",
BVWW046RA,BVWW,Raz,"It's a mystery what this thing is, but it's a bigger mystery why I'm trying to make it fall in love with me.",
BVWW047RA,BVWW,Raz,Anybody in there need some art? Hello?,
BVWW048RA,BVWW,Raz,Luggage inspector! Open up! Hello?,
BVWW049RA,BVWW,Raz,Did someone here order a single playing card? Because that's what it says right here on my sheet. Open up!,
BVWW050RA,BVWW,Raz,Anybody here interested in a magical rubber sack?,
BVWW051RA,BVWW,Raz,"Feather man! Fresh from birds. Get a feather for the grandkids! C'mon, open the window...",
BVWW052RA,BVWW,Raz,"I think I have to get something out of this, not stuff something into it.",
BVWX002RA,BVWX,Raz,Aaaaaaah-oof!,
BVWX003SB,BVWX,St.Bernard,Oh my god! Are you all right?,
BVWX004SB,BVWX,St.Bernard,Poor little guy!,
BVWX006SB,BVWX,St.Bernard,Hmmm... little nick on the frame...,
BVWX007RA,BVWX,Raz,Ohhhhh--ohhh.,
BVWX009SB,BVWX,St.Bernard,...maybe I can cover that up with a price tag or something...,
BVWX011RA,BVWX,Raz,"Hey, how do you get out of this alley?",
BVWX012SB,BVWX,St.Bernard,"We're trapped in here, son. Art is our only escape.",
BVWX013RA,BVWX,Raz,Is that like a metaphor? Or do you mean that if I take one of these paintings I can use it to get out of here?,
BVWX014SB,BVWX,St.Bernard,If you TAKE one of these paintings I'll bite you on the leg.,
BVWX015SB,BVWX,St.Bernard,"If you BUY one, it could help you get out of here.",
BVWX017SB,BVWX,St.Bernard,They're magic!,
BVWX019SB,BVWX,St.Bernard,Here's one of my newest acquisitions.,
BVWX020SB,BVWX,St.Bernard,Perfect condition.,
BVWX021SB,BVWX,St.Bernard,"It's the kind of piece that really makes a room seem larger, you know?",
BVWX022SB,BVWX,St.Bernard,Yep.,
BVWX024SB,BVWX,St.Bernard,"Okay, okay. YES there is a small nick on the frame. Okay?",
BVWX025SB,BVWX,St.Bernard,It's an antique!,
BVWX026SB,BVWX,St.Bernard,What do you want from me?,
BVWX027SB,BVWX,St.Bernard,"Art isn't about perfection, you know!",
BVWX028SB,BVWX,St.Bernard,I marked it down already!,
BVWX029SB,BVWX,St.Bernard,"At that price, you really need to let yourself be charmed by its flaws.",
BVWX031RA,BVWX,Raz,I don't think I can swing these downtown gallery prices.,
BVWX032SB,BVWX,St.Bernard,"Okay, I know you don't believe that these are magical paintings, so I'm gonna GIVE you one free. As a sample.",
BVWX033SB,BVWX,St.Bernard,Hang it up on that hook over there and you'll see.,
BVWX034SB,BVWX,St.Bernard,"Then come back and buy the rest, because they all do something special.",
BVWX036RA,BVWX,Raz,Nice! Now I can get Edgar's cards!,
BVWX037SB,BVWX,St.Bernard,"To find the cards, go in the OPPOSITE DIRECTION of the bull, but I warn you-",
BVWX038SB,BVWX,St.Bernard,El Odio is a force of nature. You can't stop him. You can't hurt him.,
BVWX039SB,BVWX,St.Bernard,"Only in the bullfighting ring can he die, and then only by the sword of the Matador.",
BVWX040RA,BVWX,Raz,"Okay, I'll STEER clear of him. Heh heh.",
BVWX042SB,BVWX,St.Bernard,"Oh, you interested in that one? Great!",
BVWX044CL,BVWX,Collie,I see you have taken a fancy to one of my favorite works.,
BVWX046DA,BVWX,Dalmatian,Careful! Don't touch it! Ooo... you might catch a disease!,
BVTI008RA,BVTI,Raz,Shut Up,
BVTI009RA,BVTI,Raz,"No, you shut up",
BVTR004TI,BVTR,Tiger,"No, you shut up.",
BVWW053RA,BVWW,Raz,Hey Bull! Do you want a hey!,
BVDA033RA,BVDA,Raz,Cause you gotta hold your breath during those.,
BVED006ED,BVED,Edgar,"With this card, I can almost reach her.  You must hurry back with the last queen!",
BVMP000MA,BVMP,Matador,"Here's a better one: you go get that billboard painted, and I'll reward you handsomely.",
