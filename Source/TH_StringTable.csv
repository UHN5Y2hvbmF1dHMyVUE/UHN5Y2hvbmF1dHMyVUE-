THSD121RA,THSD,Raz,I... I didn't mean to... I...,
THSD123RA,THSD,Raz,"Hey, can I have a ride up to the balcony please?",
THSD124HF,THSD,Yellow-Actor,"Gee, why would you want to go there? That's not a happy place!",
THSD125RA,THSD,Raz,"I... uh... want to spread some, uh, happiness over there.",
THSD126HF,THSD,Yellow-Actor,"Hey, that's a great idea! Help yourself!",

THCW008PT,THCW,Phantom,AHHGH! What have you done to me?! My beautiful face! I'll get you for this!,
THRA001BE,THRA,Becky,Hmmmmm.,
THRA002BE,THRA,Becky,I can do this. I can do this. I can do this. I am in control. I am in control. I am in control. People are listening to me. People listen to me. People care about what I have to say. People respect me. People are listening to me.,
THRA001JA,THRA,Jasper,(snarf.),
THRA001GL,THRA,Gloria,Ooooooh.,
THSD008BE,THSD,Becky,"Alright, this is it. Cue the sun in five! Four! Three!",
THSD009JA,THSD,Jasper,Ha! I've seen better shines on a shoe!,
THSD010JA,THSD,Jasper,"Yeah, you heard me! Up here, sunshine! This play stinks! You call that a costume? You look like a tin-foil ornament on top a Christmas tree of mediocrity.",
THSD011JA,THSD,Jasper,"I, Jasper Rolls, the esteemed and famous critic, say it's time to drag this whole play outside and leave it on the curb for the garbage men.",
THSD012JA,THSD,Jasper,Why don't you quit while you can still get a job as a night light! Ah-ha-ha!,
THSD013JA,THSD,Jasper,"Though predictable and melodramatic, Bonita Soleil's exits are always this reviewer's favorite part of her performance.",
THSD014BE,THSD,Becky,"Okay, let's try this one more time. Cue the sun!",
THSD015JA,THSD,Jasper,"I've heard that stars are full of hot gas, but this one takes the cake!",
THSD016JA,THSD,Jasper,...combines a supernova ego with white dwarf talent...,
THSD017JA,THSD,Jasper,"I hope you didn't forget your lines. The mind is the first thing to go in OLD AGE, you know.",
THSD018JA,THSD,Jasper,"This play needs another run through the typewriter. No, wait. Make that a shredder!",
THSD019JA,THSD,Jasper,Boooo! Get off the stage!,
THSD020JA,THSD,Jasper,Hsssss! Hsssss!,
THSD021JA,THSD,Jasper,Isn't it time for you to set?,
THSD022JA,THSD,Jasper,I can see why they say not to stare at the sun too long or you'll go blind.,
THSD023JA,THSD,Jasper,My kid puts on better plays in the backyard!,
THSD024JA,THSD,Jasper,Are you going to try to sing? Hold on. Where's my pen? I need to jam it into my ears.,
THSD025JA,THSD,Jasper,"You've got less talent than this piece of--no, wait than THIS piece of popcorn. That first one was too big!",
THAC000RA,THAC,Raz,"Excuse me, Miss Soleil? I heard you were feeling bad, so I just wanted to say that...",
THAC001RA,THAC,Raz,"...whatever you're going through, you're not alone. ",
THAC002RA,THAC,Raz,I used to be a performer myself and I know how hard it is when--,
THAC003BT,THAC,Bonita,"Kid, can't you see I'm trying to have a moment here?",
THAC004RA,THAC,Raz,Whoa. Sorry. I was looking for Bonita Soleil.,
THAC005BT,THAC,Bonita,You mean the personal muse of Gloria Von Gouton? Her inner sunshine?,
THAC006RA,THAC,Raz,"The spirit of her youth, yes.",
THAC007BT,THAC,Bonita,That's me. Whaddya want? An autograph? I'm kinda busy here.,
THAC008RA,THAC,Raz,"So, are you ready for your big number?",
THAC009BT,THAC,Bonita,Did you put a candle in that spotlight and light it yet?,
THAC010RA,THAC,Raz,"No. But I'm ABOUT to, so uh... five minutes, Miss Soleil!",
THAC011BT,THAC,Bonita,"Thanks, Sonny.",
THAC012RA,THAC,Raz,"Now you see, that performance is exactly why we need to practice.",
THAC013BT,THAC,Bonita,"Beat it, kid. I'm through.",
THAC014BT,THAC,Bonita,"As long as Jasper and that Phantom are out there, I'm staying back here...",
THAC015BT,THAC,Bonita,...wallowing in my glamorous torment.,
THAC016RA,THAC,Raz,The show must go on!,
THAC017BT,THAC,Bonita,"Yeah, it must go on without me, as long as Jasper Rolls and that Phantom are out there!",
THAC018BT,THAC,Bonita,"Sorry, kid.",
THAC019RA,THAC,Raz,They need you on stage right away for your big number!,
THAC020BT,THAC,Bonita,Am I not playing this right or something? I'm drowning in a quagmire of self pity!,
THAC021BT,THAC,Bonita,Why aren't you getting that? Should I be doing more with my hands?,
THAC022RA,THAC,Raz,So  who's that crying?,
THAC023BT,THAC,Bonita,"Oh, sorry--",
THAC024BT,THAC,Bonita,"Hey, can we kill the waterworks for a second?",
THAC025BT,THAC,Bonita,Thanks.,
THAC026BT,THAC,Bonita,It's a recording. It helps me focus.,
THAC027RA,THAC,Raz,"So, you're not going out on stage?",
THAC028BT,THAC,Bonita,Have you seen any of the plays we put on here? Those god-awful slices of Gloria's terrible life? ,
THAC029BT,THAC,Bonita,How am I supposed to bring light to those?,
THAC030BT,THAC,Bonita,"Listen, the burden of being the only sunshine in this theater is just too much for one beautiful, glowing, inspirational muse to bear you know?",
THAC031RA,THAC,Raz,You're not scared of that Phantom are you?,
THAC032BT,THAC,Bonita,"No, it's not him I'm frightened of.",
THAC033BT,THAC,Bonita,"It's that fat one who clings to the side of the theater like a blood-swollen tick, sucking out its life.",
THAC034RA,THAC,Raz,Ew.,
THAC035BT,THAC,Bonita,"He's always been there, but he wasn't always that big and loud. ",
THAC036BT,THAC,Bonita,"I couldn't hear him much at all, really, until Gloria's mother hit the stage.",
THAC037RA,THAC,Raz,He didn't like her performance either?,
THAC038BT,THAC,Bonita,"No, I mean HIT the stage. Ker-splat.",
THAC039BT,THAC,Bonita,Jumped from the catwalks while Gloria was in Paris. ,
THAC041BT,THAC,Bonita,"Yeah, that's what the janitor said too.",
THAC042RA,THAC,Raz,I haven't seen any plays. How do I see a play?,
THAC043BT,THAC,Bonita,"Well, those actors are worthless without a good script.",
THAC044BT,THAC,Bonita,"Just find a script and give it to that bossy little dynamo with the headphones, she'll know what to do.",
THAC045RA,THAC,Raz,Where do I find a script?,
THAC046BT,THAC,Bonita,"Those actors are always hiding copies on one set or another, in case they forget their lines.",
THAC047BT,THAC,Bonita,"And that mean, fat, horrible Jasper has one he's always trying to get produced.",
THAC048BT,THAC,Bonita,"When you find a script, give it to Becky Houndstooth.",
THAC049BT,THAC,Bonita,"But be careful.  If you play a script on a set it wasn't written for, you never know what might happen!",
THAC050RA,THAC,Raz,Is there any way I can get you to take the stage? For the fans?,
THAC051BT,THAC,Bonita,"If you can get me some help out there, so I'm not the only light on the set...",
THAC052RA,THAC,Raz,I'll turn on a spotlight!,
THAC053BT,THAC,Bonita,"Eh, that could work, but you'll need a candle...",
THAC054BT,THAC,Bonita,I think there might be a spare in the storeroom.,
THAC055BT,THAC,Bonita,"If you can get a candle into a spotlight and light it, I'll come out and give the show one last try.",
THAC056BT,THAC,Bonita,But I'm not promising anything!,
THAC057RA,THAC,Raz,I'll leave you alone now. I know you have a lot of crying to do.,
THAC058BT,THAC,Bonita,Thank you. Now where was I?,
THJA000JA,THJA,Jasper,ZZzzzzzZZZzz.,
THJA001JA,THJA,Jasper,ZZzzzz. ZzzZZZZZZ.,
THJA002JA,THJA,Jasper,Zzzzzz-ZZzzzzz.,
THJA003RA,THJA,Raz,"Hey, can you help me get up to the catwalks so I can fight that phantom?",
THJA004JA,THJA,Jasper,Ha! Can't get there from here! Ha ha ha!,
THJA005JA,THJA,Jasper,"I mean, unless you did that one, particular play on that one, particular set...",
THJA006JA,THJA,Jasper,"Oh, but what am I saying? That's almost impossible. ",
THJA007JA,THJA,Jasper,Forget about it. The theater is doomed!,
THJA009JA,THJA,Jasper,"Ah, you've tasted excellence, and now you're back, begging for another bowl of quality theater?",
THJA011JA,THJA,Jasper,"Ew, oh. Well unfortunately for you that's the last script I'll waste on this theater. ",
THJA012JA,THJA,Jasper,I'm saving the rest for Broadway!,
THJA013JA,THJA,Jasper,Just dig around the sets. I'm sure you'll find some horrible scripts in there. ,
THJA014JA,THJA,Jasper,"Oh, except do NOT do that, because they certainly would NOT help you get to the catwalks, which are very dangerous anyway, so give up.",
THJA015RA,THJA,Raz,You're mean and fat.,
THJA016JA,THJA,Jasper,And?,
THJA017RA,THJA,Raz,Just giving you the update.,
THJA018JA,THJA,Jasper,At least I'm good at it.,
THJA020JA,THJA,Jasper,I'm trying to save you from that mysterious Phantom character!,
THJA021JA,THJA,Jasper,He only attacks when Bonita performs!,
THJA022JA,THJA,Jasper,"If we got rid of Little Miss Sunshine, we'd all be safer now wouldn't we?",
THJA023JA,THJA,Jasper,I'm only thinking of the children. ,
THJA025JA,THJA,Jasper,"The young boy's protests, though heartfelt, quickly lapsed into simplistic and tedious platitudes. One and a half stars!",
THJA026RA,THJA,Raz,Bonita's just trying to lighten things up around here!,
THJA028JA,THJA,Jasper,"She should quit now, while she can still get a job as a night light.",
THJA029RA,THJA,Raz,"If you hate the show so much, why don't you just leave?",
THJA030JA,THJA,Jasper,I can't stop looking at it. It's like the sight of a horrible car accident.,
THJA031JA,THJA,Jasper,"A car accident where the victims can't act, and the paramedics forget their lines.",
THJA032RA,THJA,Raz,"Alright, later, you old gas bag.",
THJA033JA,THJA,Jasper,"Listen, this play just stinks. Here. Try this one instead.",
THJA034JA,THJA,Jasper,"This play has some ACTION in it, some zing!",
THJA035RA,THJA,Raz,"Wow, thanks. Are you actually being nice?",
THJA036JA,THJA,Jasper,No! I'm just trying to keep myself halfway entertained!,
THJA037JA,THJA,Jasper,Go! Give that to Becky and see if she can't find some actors to ruin it!,
THJA038JA,THJA,Jasper,Ha. Break a leg.,
THJA008RA,THJA,Raz,"Excuse me, Mr. Rolls, but do you have any more scripts?",
THJA010RA,THJA,Raz,"Not really. But I think that if I find a play that moves the props around in just the right way, I can use them to get up to the catwalks and fight the Phantom!",
THJA019RA,THJA,Raz,"Hey, why do you have to be so hard on Bonita?",
THJA024RA,THJA,Raz,"If you can't say something nice, don't say anything at all.",
THBF000SF,THBF,Pink-Flower,And where would Gloria be without her muse?,
THBF001HF,THBF,Yellow-Actor,Her inner sunshine!,
THBF002FF,THBF,Orange-Flower,The spirit of her youth!,
THBF003SF,THBF,Pink-Flower,"Played tonight, once again, by...",
THBF004SF,THBF,Pink-Flower,Bonita Soleil!,
THBF007JA,THBF,Jasper,"You'd better listen to me! You're no good! This play stinks! It's worse than ever before! Oh, I can't believe you call this theater!",
THBF008JA,THBF,Jasper,"I can't even see it from down here, but I know it's bad! Can you hear me?",
THBF009JA,THBF,Jasper,"Oh, you've got fat arms, you hear me? Big fat arms like a wrestler!",
THBF010JA,THBF,Jasper,And a little turkey gobble hanging from your neck!,
THBF011JA,THBF,Jasper,"Oh, your knees are ugly, and you snort when you laugh!",
THBI000RA,THBI,Raz,"Okay Phantom, it's time to find out who--",
THBI001RA,THBI,Raz,...you really are.,
THBI002RA,THBI,Raz,What?,
THBI003RA,THBI,Raz,I totally guessed that!,
THBI004FF,THBI,Orange-Flower,Nuh-uh. You said it was Becky!,
THBI005RA,THBI,Raz,Tssssst!,
THBI006RA,THBI,Raz,"Okay, the jig is up, PHANTOM!",
THBI007JA,THBI,Jasper,"What? Why, I never! How dare you accuse me of being the rugged and romantic scoundrel that has thrilled and terrified audiences for years!",

THBI009JA,THBI,Jasper,Why you! Of course it's me!,
THBI010RA,THBI,Raz,"Well it's time to hang up the cape, Tubs, because your days of terrorizing the theater as the Phantom are over.",
THBI011JA,THBI,Jasper,"Maybe as the Phantom, but he's nothing compared to the full, destructive force of an angry critic! Ha ha ha!",
THBI012RA,THBI,Raz,Hmm. How can I say this and still sound cool... sticks and stones may break my bones but words will never hurt me?,
