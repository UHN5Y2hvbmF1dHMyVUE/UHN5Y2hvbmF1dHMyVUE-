MMAC002RA,MMAC,Raz,The Milkman's dead??? Ah crud.,
MMAC003BO,MMAC,Boyd,Burned up in a department store fire. Didn't you hear?,
MMAC005BO,MMAC,Boyd,...Is he dead or not?,
MMAC007RA,MMAC,Raz,Where is the Milkman?,
MMAC008BO,MMAC,Boyd,"Well, he's NOT in the graveyard, so that's the first place you should look.",

MMAA009RA,MMAA,Raz,"Okay, I went to the Book Depository, and all that happened was a little girl jumped out a window. It was kind of depressing, actually.",
MMAA010BO,MMAA,Boyd,Did you talk to the birds up there? Did you ask them if they saw anything with their electric eyes?,
MMAA011RA,MMAA,Raz,"Hey, I found the Milkman.",
MMAA012BO,MMAA,Boyd,"Big deal. I knew where he was the whole time. Getting past the red head, that's the problem.",

MMAK014BO,MMAK,Boyd,You think I'm crazy? What if I'm the only one who's sane?,
MMAK015RA,MMAK,Raz,Is this yours?,
MMAK016BO,MMAK,Boyd,No. I don't trust pies.,
MMAK017RA,MMAK,Raz,Do you have a real one of these? Like the kind that shoots bullets?,
MMAK018BO,MMAK,Boyd,Give a loaded gun to a 10 year old? Do I look crazy to you?,
MMAK019RA,MMAK,Raz,"Hey, take off your hat and I'll give your bangs a little touch up with these.",

MMAL008GM,MMAL,G-Man,Sorry. Road Crew only.,
MMAL009GM,MMAL,G-Man,"This is my home, not Grand Central Station. Get out!",
MMAL010GM,MMAL,G-Man,Ha ha. Do you not realize that we are deadly assassins? Are you not afraid?,
MMAL011GM,MMAL,G-Man,I cannot let someone near my hedges who has not been properly trained in the use of the trimmers.,
MMAL012GM,MMAL,G-Man,"Unless you have water for my plants, then we have no use for you in here.",

MMAL019GM,MMAL,G-Man,Oh my god. Why do I have a gun in my hand? I hope I didn't kill again.,
MMAL020GM,MMAL,G-Man,Why am I trimming hedges? I pay a gardener good money to do this for me.,
MMAL021GM,MMAL,G-Man,Okay I have to think. Do this watering can and I have a history?,
MMAL022GM,MMAL,G-Man,I should be out trying to find the Milkman!,
MMAL023GM,MMAL,G-Man,Oh yeah. That's right. Disguise. Ahem.,
MMAL024GM,MMAL,G-Man,Please. Sir. We have infrared vision.,
MMAL025GM,MMAL,G-Man,I am on fire. I am uncomfortable. Initiating countermeasures.,

MMAL030GM,MMAL,G-Man,Glad to have you here on the job.,
MMAL031GM,MMAL,G-Man,Gross. What a terrible job that must be. I would never let you date my daughter.,
MMAL032GM,MMAL,G-Man,As do I. We must stick together against those who would judge us.,
MMAL033GM,MMAL,G-Man,We have no use for road work here.,
MMAL034GM,MMAL,G-Man,"Yes, we are all on the road crew. Our backs are killing us.",
MMAL035GM,MMAL,G-Man,I hope it is rhubarb pie because that is my favorite.,
MMAL036GM,MMAL,G-Man,I like all pies except for rhubarb. Do you know that rhubarb is poisonous in large quantities?,
MMAL037GM,MMAL,G-Man,"I hope you are not trying to steal my husband, tramp.",
MMAL038GM,MMAL,G-Man,You are a cold-blooded killer. But it takes all kinds to make a world.,
MMAL039GM,MMAL,G-Man,Shhh! Don't broadcast that fact. They look real.,
MMAL040GM,MMAL,G-Man,"Why don't you go do that, then? Somewhere else.",
MMAL041GM,MMAL,G-Man,It is a good day for that activity you mention. Please join me.,
MMAL042GM,MMAL,G-Man,That is a fine vocation. You should practice it near some flowers.,
MMAL043GM,MMAL,G-Man,Me too! Perhaps we can swap watering tips.,
MMAL044GM,MMAL,G-Man,Please do not do that.,
MMAL045GM,MMAL,G-Man,Who is the Crow?,
MMAL046GM,MMAL,G-Man,Who does the Crow work for?,

MMAN001RA,MMAN,Raz,Hm. This must be the Milkman's grave.,
MMAN002RA,MMAN,Raz,...But it's completely overgrown with vines.  How am I going to get in there?,
MMAN003RA,MMAN,Raz,Can't get a good grip.,
MMAN004RA,MMAN,Raz,"Well, at least they're confused.",

MMAO013RA,MMAO,Raz,"Hey, can I come in and look around? I want to see the view from your helicopter!",
MMAO014RA,MMAO,Raz,Whoops.,
MMAO015RA,MMAO,Raz,I'm not close enough to use Clairvoyance. I need to get up higher!,

MMAO019RA,MMAO,Raz,Ha! I've hacked it! This will work for sure!,
MMAO020RA,MMAO,Raz,Rats.,
MMAO021RA,MMAO,Raz,Ah ha! That should fry the circuitry and allow me--,
