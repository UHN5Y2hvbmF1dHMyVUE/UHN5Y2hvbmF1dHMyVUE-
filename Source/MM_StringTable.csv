MMAH007RA,Raz,It does?,
MMAH008BO,Boyd,Yes! I knew it! I was completely wrong about everything! But now I've got it! ,
MMAH009BO,Boyd,That book came from the Book Depository.,
MMAH010BO,Boyd,"They must want to make us think that's where they want us to go, because they think we'll think we know they know we know, so we won't go! ",
MMAH011RA,Raz,So I shouldn't go to the Book Depository?,
MMAH012BO,Boyd,"Of course you're going to the Book Depository! Take the sewers. Watch out for watchers. And radioactives. And perpetrators! Some of those sewer workers are involved, I think.",
MMAH013BO,Boyd,You'll need one of these...,
MMAH014RA,Raz,Now we're talking!,

MMAJ002RA,Raz,I like to trim hedges.,
MMAJ004RA,Raz,I work in the sewers.,
MMAJ005RA,Raz,I am a skilled phone repairer.,
MMAJ006RA,Raz,It's fake. I'm worried the other assassins are going to make fun of me.,
MMAJ007RA,Raz,I'm watering!,
MMAK000BO,Boyd,Ah! I'm telling you! I don't know where the Milkman is!,
MMAK001BO,Boyd,Ah! They've come for me! They are taking me away!,
MMAK002BO,Boyd,"Wait a minute. I think there might not be a conspiracy after all. It's possible I am suffering from paranoid delusions, linked to an entity I call ""the Milkman"" who is, in actuality...",
MMAK003BO,Boyd,...the mummified remains of Abraham Lincoln!,
MMAK004BO,Boyd,"Oh, no! It's happening again!",

MMAK015RA,Raz,Is this yours?,
MMAK016BO,Boyd,No. I don't trust pies.,
MMAK017RA,Raz,Do you have a real one of these? Like the kind that shoots bullets?,
MMAK018BO,Boyd,Give a loaded gun to a 10 year old? Do I look crazy to you?,
MMAK019RA,Raz,"Hey, take off your hat and I'll give your bangs a little touch up with these.",
MMAK020BO,Boyd,"Ha ha. Nice attempt to get my hat. Anyway, I took the microfilm out of there days ago.",
MMAK021RA,Raz,Look what I found.,
MMAK022BO,Boyd,Shh! It may be bugged!,
MMAK023BO,Boyd,Ah! Get it off me! Black death!,
MMAL000RA,Raz,"Hey, are you following me?",
MMAL001RA,Raz,I don't want to throw that away!,
MMAL002RA,Raz,I don't want to mail that. I don't want to mail anything in this creepy mailbox.,
MMAL003GM,G-Man,"Why don't you come in here and do that, tough guy?",
MMAL004RA,Raz,"Hey, I'm just going to walk through okay?",
MMAL005GM,G-Man,"Sorry, we widows are busy grieving in here.",

MMAL009GM,G-Man,"This is my home, not Grand Central Station. Get out!",
MMAL010GM,G-Man,Ha ha. Do you not realize that we are deadly assassins? Are you not afraid?,
MMAL011GM,G-Man,I cannot let someone near my hedges who has not been properly trained in the use of the trimmers.,
MMAL012GM,G-Man,"Unless you have water for my plants, then we have no use for you in here.",
MMAL013GM,G-Man,"Ohhhhh... ohhhh... whoa, whoa... ohhh.",
MMAL014GM,G-Man,Why am I in a grave yard? Am I dead?,
MMAL015GM,G-Man,Who is this? Why did you call me?,
MMAL016GM,G-Man,What am I doing in this smelly sewer? Disgusting!,
MMAL017GM,G-Man,What am I doing out here with this strange paddle in my hand?,
MMAL018GM,G-Man,What's this? I hate pie!,
MMAL019GM,G-Man,Oh my god. Why do I have a gun in my hand? I hope I didn't kill again.,
MMAL020GM,G-Man,Why am I trimming hedges? I pay a gardener good money to do this for me.,
MMAL021GM,G-Man,Okay I have to think. Do this watering can and I have a history?,
MMAL022GM,G-Man,I should be out trying to find the Milkman!,
MMAL023GM,G-Man,Oh yeah. That's right. Disguise. Ahem.,
MMAL024GM,G-Man,Please. Sir. We have infrared vision.,
MMAL025GM,G-Man,I am on fire. I am uncomfortable. Initiating countermeasures.,

MMAL028GM,G-Man,I am your sister in grief.,
MMAL029GM,G-Man,"Yes. You should be over there, working on the phone lines.",
MMAL030GM,G-Man,Glad to have you here on the job.,
MMAL031GM,G-Man,Gross. What a terrible job that must be. I would never let you date my daughter.,
MMAL032GM,G-Man,As do I. We must stick together against those who would judge us.,
MMAL033GM,G-Man,We have no use for road work here.,
MMAL034GM,G-Man,"Yes, we are all on the road crew. Our backs are killing us.",
MMAL035GM,G-Man,I hope it is rhubarb pie because that is my favorite.,
MMAL036GM,G-Man,I like all pies except for rhubarb. Do you know that rhubarb is poisonous in large quantities?,
MMAL037GM,G-Man,"I hope you are not trying to steal my husband, tramp.",
MMAL038GM,G-Man,You are a cold-blooded killer. But it takes all kinds to make a world.,
MMAL039GM,G-Man,Shhh! Don't broadcast that fact. They look real.,
MMAL040GM,G-Man,"Why don't you go do that, then? Somewhere else.",
MMAL041GM,G-Man,It is a good day for that activity you mention. Please join me.,
MMAL042GM,G-Man,That is a fine vocation. You should practice it near some flowers.,
MMAL043GM,G-Man,Me too! Perhaps we can swap watering tips.,
MMAL044GM,G-Man,Please do not do that.,
MMAL045GM,G-Man,Who is the Crow?,
MMAL046GM,G-Man,Who does the Crow work for?,
MMAL047GM,G-Man,What is the mission of the Crow?,
MMAM000RS,Rainbow-Squirt,"Ow! I'm only trying to make money for our organization, sir!",

MMAN000RA,Raz,The vines are too thick! They won't break.,
MMAN001RA,Raz,Hm. This must be the Milkman's grave.,
MMAN002RA,Raz,...But it's completely overgrown with vines.  How am I going to get in there?,
MMAN003RA,Raz,Can't get a good grip.,
MMAN004RA,Raz,"Well, at least they're confused.",
MMAN005RA,Raz,Yes! Burn!,
MMAN006RA,Raz,"Man, I hope no one notices all this fire.",

MMAO006RA,Raz,"Excuse me, you in the car. Phone's for you. Why don't you come out and get it?",
MMAO007RA,Raz,"Hey, you in the car. Free plunger. Gotta come out to get it.",
MMAO008RA,Raz,"Hey, you in the car! Stop! And exit the vehicle please.",
MMAO009RA,Raz,"Alright, come out of the car right now or I will roll this all over your hood.",
MMAO010RA,Raz,"Okay, come out of the car right now or I'll shoot!",
MMAO011RA,Raz,I'm going to take these hedge clippers and scratch the heck out of that car if you don't show your faces right now.,
MMAO012RA,Raz,"Hey, looks like you're overheating. Why don't you come out so I can give you this water for your engine?",
MMAO013RA,Raz,"Hey, can I come in and look around? I want to see the view from your helicopter!",
MMAO014RA,Raz,Whoops.,
MMAO015RA,Raz,I'm not close enough to use Clairvoyance. I need to get up higher!,
MMAO016RA,Raz,"Stop, helicopter! Land and let me in! I want to see the view from up there please!",
MMAO017RA,Raz,"Hey, you in the helicopter! I've got a--oh they don't care.",
MMAO018RA,Raz,I have a feeling that didn't mean much to them.,
MMAO019RA,Raz,Ha! I've hacked it! This will work for sure!,
MMAO020RA,Raz,Rats.,
MMAO021RA,Raz,Ah ha! That should fry the circuitry and allow me--,
MMAO022RA,Raz,"I could use that, but I should probably just use my finger.",
MMAO023RA,Raz,"Well, if that didn't work then I am completely out of ideas.",
