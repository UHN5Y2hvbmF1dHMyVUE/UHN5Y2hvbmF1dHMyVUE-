CABD001RA,CABD,Raz,Dogen! Are you okay? I had the strangest machine-induced dream about you!,
CABD002DO,CABD,Dogen,TV?,
CABD003RA,CABD,Raz,"Well, first of all, Sasha Nein invited me down to his SECRET LAB and--",
CABD005RA,CABD,Raz,He's completely brainless!,
CABD006RA,CABD,Raz,The dream was true!,
CABD007RA,CABD,Raz,"Dogen, don't worry. I know where your brains are. They're in... like, this crazy, dream-thorn-bush-straight-jacket-tower place.",
CABD008DO,CABD,Dogen,Hackey sack?,
CABD009RA,CABD,Raz,You go to the TV lounge. I'm on the case. I just need a little more advanced training to prepare,
CAJI015FO,CAJI,Ford,You'd better hurry on up there. Morry's already started in on those kids. Can't you hear 'em screaming?,
CAJI016FO,CAJI,Ford,"Nothing like the sound of kids screamin' bloody murder on a hot summer day, eh?",
CALD001RA,CALD,Raz,Lili!,
CALD002LI,CALD,Lili,"Oh, hey Raz.",
CALD003LI,CALD,Lili,"Listen, I made you something. It's kind of stupid, but--",
CALD004RA,CALD,Raz,They stole Dogen's brains!,
CALD005LI,CALD,Lili,"No, he's just like that.",
CALD006RA,CALD,Raz,I had a nightmare where this mad scientist guy said he was going to take them out and--,
CALD007LI,CALD,Lili,"Was it a creepy-looking freak with a shower cap and a stainless steel, three pronged claw?",
CALD008RA,CALD,Raz,Hey! That's MY nightmare!,
CALD009LI,CALD,Lili,So it's not just me,
CALD010RA,CALD,Raz,But how? And why all the meat?,
CALD011LI,CALD,Lili,"I don't know, but I think it's time I find out where this is coming from.",
CALD012RA,CALD,Raz,Once I get trained in Levitation I'll be able to see the rest of the nightmare and get more information.,
CALD013LI,CALD,Lili,Let's rendezvous tonight at the old boathouse for debriefing.,
CALD014RA,CALD,Raz,This is so cool.,
CALD015LI,CALD,Lili,"Yeah, it feels like that time in ""True Psychic Tales"" 314 where--",
CALD016RA,CALD,Raz,What did you just say?,
CALD017LI,CALD,Lili,Shut up!,
CALK001RA,CALK,Raz,"Bobby! Uh-oh. Look, I can explain--",

CALK004BZ,CALK,Bobby,TV!,
CALK005LI,CALK,Lili,Ahh-choo!,
CALK006RA,CALK,Raz,"Geez, it sounds like you caught a bad cold.",
CALK007LI,CALK,Lili,"Maybe, but LISTEN! I traced the psychic interference back to Coach Oleander's radio!",
CALK008LI,CALK,Lili,He's been broadcasting his insane plot all over camp in his sleep!,
CALK009RA,CALK,Raz,So he's really kidnapping children and stealing their brains to make weapons!,
CALK010LI,CALK,Lili,Yes! Isn't that great?,
CALK011RA,CALK,Raz,What? How is that great?,
CALK012LI,CALK,Lili,Because this is an honest-to-goodness psychic emergency!,
CALK013RA,CALK,Raz,"And Sasha's not here! He left on some ""official Psychonauts business.""",
CALK014LI,CALK,Lili,Milla left a note saying the same thing!,
CALK015RA,CALK,Raz,"Lili, a deranged madman is building an army of psychic death tanks to take over the world, and there's no one who can stop him except for you and me!",
CALK016LI,CALK,Lili,Oh my god!,
CALK017LI,CALK,Lili,Let's make out!,
CALK018RA,CALK,Raz,"Uh, what??",
CALK019LI,CALK,Lili,Sorry! I'm just so excited!,
CALK020LI,CALK,Lili,"Since you showed up, Raz, things are so much more exciting!",
CALK021LI,CALK,Lili,Sinister death plots! Mad scientists!,
CALK022LI,CALK,Lili,Hideous monsters!,
CALK023RA,CALK,Raz,Make out?,
CALK024LI,CALK,Lili,"How long have I ignored what this camp had to offer? Everything's new to me now thanks to you! I mean, look at this flower!",
CALK025RA,CALK,Raz,"You mean, like... kiss?",
CALK026LI,CALK,Lili,How many years have I been coming here and I've never even noticed a cool flower like this before?,
CALK027RA,CALK,Raz,Ahhhh--ooof!,
CALK028LI,CALK,Lili,"Oh, no! You didn't just hit my boyfriend!",
CALK029RA,CALK,Raz,Spit her out! I'm gonna Heimlich you so bad!,
CALK030RA,CALK,Raz,Lili!!!,
CALP001RA,CALP,Raz,"Hey, Lili.",
CALP002LI,CALP,Lili,Going for the advanced training? What's the rush?,
CALP003RA,CALP,Raz,Are you kidding? I only have a few days to become a Psychonaut or I lose my shot forever!,
CALP004LI,CALP,Lili,"Look, Raz, I hate to burst your bubble, but the Psychonauts are not what they used to be.",
CALP005LI,CALP,Lili,Times have changed. The world just doesn't need us anymore.,
CALP006RA,CALP,Raz,The world does too need Psychonauts!,
CALP007RA,CALP,Raz,"Right here at this very camp, in fact. I think there are several fishy things that need psychic investigating.",
CALP008LI,CALP,Lili,You are so immature!,
CALP009LI,CALP,Lili,And cute! When are you gonna just shut up and kiss me?,
CALP010RA,CALP,Raz,Shut up and do what?,
CALP011LI,CALP,Lili,"Oh. I didn't know you could--uh, I gotta go. Bye.",
CALP012LI,CALP,Lili,So embarrassing!,
CALU002RA,CALU,Raz,Gah!,
CALU003RA,CALU,Raz,"Hey, was that you? Looking at me?",
CALU004LI,CALU,Lili,Maybe you should try getting over yourself? There were a lot of other people on that stage besides you.,
CALU005RA,CALU,Raz,"No, just now. In the woods.",
CALU006RA,CALU,Raz,(sniff sniff),
CALU007RA,CALU,Raz,"No, it must have been something else.",
CALU008RA,CALU,Raz,You don't smell like pond scum.,
CALU009LI,CALU,Lili,Nice. You should write greeting cards.,
CALU010LI,CALU,Lili,"Hey, if you want to cut class later, try these smelling salts.",
CALU011LI,CALU,Lili,"They'll pop you out of anyone's mind and back to the real world before you can say, Crud! That hurts my nose!",
CALU012RA,CALU,Raz,Out of anyone's mind?,
CALU013LI,CALU,Lili,You'll find out.,
CALU014LI,CALU,Lili,"Now, mush! We don't want you to be late for class!",
CALU015RA,CALU,Raz,Why do you care if I'm late for class?,
CALU016LI,CALU,Lili,Because the late thing is MY thing. Don't copy.,
CALU017RA,CALU,Raz,There was some sort of shadowy being out there... lurking... watching...,
CALU018LI,CALU,Lili,"I know of only one creature who fits that description. It likes to hide in dark places, silently watching unsuspecting children from a distance.",
CALU019RA,CALU,Raz,Really? Who?,
CALU020LI,CALU,Lili,"You, tree sitter!  Hahahaha!",
CASR001BN,CASR,Benny,Way to make us look bad in there! You're in trouble now! Bobby Zilch ain't happy.,
CASR002BZ,CASR,Bobby,"You better watch yourself, Gogglicious.",
CASR003RA,CASR,Raz,"What's that, Hair Boy? You want a piece of me?",
CASR004LI,CASR,Lili,"Hey, brainiacs. Settle down.",
CASR005BZ,CASR,Bobby,Why? You worried I'm gonna hurt your boyfriend?,
CASR006LI,CASR,Lili,No. Because Sasha Nein is standing right behind you.,
CASR007SA,CASR,Sasha,"Your performance, young cadet, was outstanding. I'd like you to report to my lab for some advanced training.",
CASR008BZ,CASR,Bobby,"Oooh! Raz the Spaz is gonna be in the ""special"" class. Benny, remind me to give him a ""special"" beating later, okay?",
CASR009SA,CASR,Sasha,"These tests are unauthorized, though, so I can't actually ask you to come. But if you happened to drop in, well, what could I do? Let me just give you this...",
CASR010SA,CASR,Sasha,Remember:,
CASR011SA,CASR,Sasha,"Your talent will always set you apart, Razputin.",
CASR012SA,CASR,Sasha,Sometimes isolation is a good thing. It can lead to important discoveries.,
CASR013RA,CASR,Raz,"Wait, I don't even know where your lab is! Is this some kind of test?",
CASR015RA,CASR,Raz,And now I'm hearing things. Great.,

INBB008CO,INBB,Coach,"I know what a U.P.E. is, son. I just don't know how YOU know.",
INBB009RA,INBB,Raz,"From ""True Psychic Tales"" Issue 424, sir!",

INTR016CO,INTR,Coach,Psychonauts!,
INTR017CO,INTR,Coach,The rest of you... WILL DIE.,
INTR018DO,INTR,Dogen,Waaaaaaaa!,
INTR019SA,INTR,Sasha,"Oh, Morry.",
INTR020MI,INTR,Milla,"Children, you are not going to die.",
INTR021CO,INTR,Coach,"Well, if you're not a Psychonaut, then you might as well be dead!",
INTR022DO,INTR,Dogen,They told me this was a Summer Camp!,
INTR023LI,INTR,Lili,"Ah, Dogen. Don't worry about ol' Coach Oleander. I've been coming here for years, and trust me--nothing ever happens.",
INTR024BZ,INTR,Bobby,"Yeah, Dogen. Lili's right. You don't got nothin' to worry about... 'cept for that giant monster in the lake I was telling you about.",
INTR025CO,INTR,Coach,"Bobby Zilch! I told you to stop scaring people with that ridiculous, old legend!",
INTR026CO,INTR,Coach,I don't want the kids to be afraid to go out at night and walk alone on the perfectly safe paths of Whispering Rock Psychic Summer Camp.,

INTR051RA,INTR,Raz,"I know! Isn't it great? Listen, why don't I just sit over here quietly with my fellow PSI Cadets--",
INTR052RA,INTR,Raz,"Hey, how's it going? I like your hat!",
INTR053SA,INTR,Sasha,We need to have this young man taken from here immediately.,
INTR054MI,INTR,Milla,I'll call his parents.,
INTR055RA,INTR,Raz,What? But... don't you train Psychonauts here?,
INTR056MI,INTR,Milla,"Yes, darling, but--",
INTR057RA,INTR,Raz,To soar across the astral plane?,
INTR058RA,INTR,Raz,To wage psychic warfare against the enemies of free thought?,
INTR059CO,INTR,Coach,That is what I wrote on the front of the pamphlet...,
INTR060RA,INTR,Raz,"Those words are why I'm here, Coach Oleander. Do you remember what you wrote on the inside of that pamphlet?",
INTR061RA,INTR,Raz,"""You were born with a special gift. But the people around you treat it like a curse. Your mother is afraid of you, and your father looks at you with shame in his eyes. Come to Whispering Rock Psychic Summer Camp, and you can show them all! Back home, your powers make you a loner, an outcast, a circus freak. But in this dojo, in this Psychic dojo, they make you a hero.""",
INTR062CO,INTR,Coach,Get that soldier a bunk!,
INTR063MI,INTR,Milla,"Now, darling. You can stay here for a few days until your parents come for you. But we can't let you participate in any paranormal training without your parents' consent. I'm sorry.",
INTR064DO,INTR,Dogen,Wowee. You're so lucky. You get to go home soon.,
INTR065RA,INTR,Raz,Home? Back there I was just like you were Dogen--punished by my own family for having powers I never asked for.,
INTR066RA,INTR,Raz,"But here, I have a chance to be something. To make a difference.",
INTR067RA,INTR,Raz,"They may come for me, Dogen, but they'll be looking for Raz, the boy. What they're going to find",
INTR068RA,INTR,Raz,"What they don't expect, is Raz, the Psychonaut.",
INTR069DO,INTR,Dogen,And--and--and then you'll make their heads explode?,
INTR070RA,INTR,Raz,No! Do you do that?,
INTR071DO,INTR,Dogen,No!,
INTR072DO,INTR,Dogen,"No! Well, once kinda. But, now I wear this special hat. Wanna try it on?",
INTR073RA,INTR,Raz,No no no!,
INTR074SA,INTR,Sasha,"But he has mental defenses like I've never seen in someone so young. If I could just get him in my lab for some experiments, I'm sure he could withstand more than the others!",
INTR075CO,INTR,Coach,"That kid's one in a million, Nein. But I'm not going to let you turn him into one of your guinea pigs!",
INTR076CO,INTR,Coach,I've got big plans for that mind.,
INTR077MI,INTR,Milla,"Quickly, bring it over here",
SLAC001RA,SLAC,Raz,Ahhh!,
SLAC002SA,SLAC,Sasha,Hmm. That should not have happened. We need to try that again.,
SLAC003RA,SLAC,Raz,"Oh, I don't think I need to be in the Tumbler with the glowy eye guys anymore.",
SLAC004SA,SLAC,Sasha,Suit yourself.,
SLAC005SA,SLAC,Sasha,"You know, in many tribal societies, learning to defeat the monsters you see in your dreams is considered a rite of passage.",
SLAC006SA,SLAC,Sasha,I can train you to fight. Come see me when you're ready.,
SLAM001SA,SLAM,Sasha,"Okay, okay. Enough about my mind. Let's stay out of my mind for a while. Let's just go back into yours, huh?",
SLAM002SA,SLAM,Sasha,Step up to the Brain Tumbler when you're ready.,
SLBT001RA,SLBT,Raz,"So, what's this hair dryer thing do?",
SLBT002SA,SLBT,Sasha,"Ah, you're ready for the Brain Tumbler.",
SLBT003SA,SLBT,Sasha,"With this device we will send you deep into your own psyche, where you should find unparalleled insight and power.",
SLBT004RA,SLBT,Raz,Excellent. Tumble away.,
SLBT005SA,SLBT,Sasha,"Now just relax. This will not hurt, unless something really very bad happens.",
SLBT006SA,SLBT,Sasha,"One more time, for the good of science!",
SLBT007SA,SLBT,Sasha,Let's go mess up your mind for a change.,
SLBT008SA,SLBT,Sasha,Let's see if Milla taught you anything.,
SLIN001RA,SLIN,Raz,Agent Nein? I'm here for the advanced training!,
SLIN002RA,SLIN,Raz,"So, what are we going to learn? Bending spoons? Burning stuff?",
SLIN003RA,SLIN,Raz,I've been hearing a lot about head explosion and I was wondering--,
SLIN004SA,SLIN,Sasha,"Science, Razputin. That is what we practice down here. Not parlor tricks.",
SLIN005SA,SLIN,Sasha,"If you are serious about exploring the possibilities of your mind, step up to the Brain Tumbler and we'll begin.",
SLIN006RA,SLIN,Raz,Brain tumbler?,
SLIS001RA,SLIS,Raz,Okay. Teach me to fight.,
SLIS002SA,SLIS,Sasha,Very well. The secret is all up here.,

BBBI033RA,BBBI,Raz,Yes sir!,
CAMD002MI,CAMD,Milla,"Oh, darling. You know I'd love to, but Sasha and the Coach are so strict, you know, and--",
CAMD004MI,CAMD,Milla,"You know I'd expect that sort of recklessness from Morceau, but Sasha?",
CAMD006MI,CAMD,Milla,Sasha said that? Really? I didn't know he noticed...,
CAMD007MI,CAMD,Milla,"Well, let us see if you are mentally prepared for this endeavor, young man.",
CAMD008MI,CAMD,Milla,"Oh, darling. You're just not ready. Maybe in a few months.",
CAMD010MI,CAMD,Milla,"Oh, now, there there. Cheer up.",

CALG004CO,CALG,Coach,Now...,
CALG005CO,CALG,Coach,LIGHTS OUT!,
CAAM001PH,CAAM,Phoebe,"Uhhg! That has got to be the worst band name I have ever heard, in the history of ever, of all time, ever.",
CAAM002QU,CAAM,Quentin,"And by ""worst"" did you possibly mean, ""The best?"" Because that's what I was thinking.",
CAAM003PH,CAAM,Phoebe,"No I meant worst, as in I can't even believe we're friends it's so bad.",
CAAM004QU,CAAM,Quentin,"Look deeply into your heart, Phoebe, and I think you'll find that even you believe ""The Levitators"" is pretty much the dopest name a band could ever have.",
CAAM005PH,CAAM,Phoebe,The Levitators? Are we some sort of cover band that only plays graduation ceremonies for motivational seminars?,
CAAM006QU,CAAM,Quentin,"I've been practicing, and I think I could levitate us both during our gigs. For real now.",
CAAM007PH,CAAM,Phoebe,"No way. Last year, you dropped me and I broke my drums.",
CAAM008QU,CAAM,Quentin,"Hey, at least those got fixed. I'll never get back those records you melted with that unplanned pyrotechnics display of yours.",
CAAM009PH,CAAM,Phoebe,"Look, you know when I have a good solo going, sometimes things get hot. I can't help it. And it'd seem like part of the show if we named the band the right thing...",
CAAM010QU,CAAM,Quentin,"Oh, not this again.",
CAAM011PH,CAAM,Phoebe,Ahem. Ladies and Gentlemen!,
CAAM012QU,CAAM,Quentin,Please.,

CAAM016QU,CAAM,Quentin,"Oh, man.",
CAAM017PH,CAAM,Phoebe,Raaaaa!,
CAAM018QU,CAAM,Quentin,"If we're gonna call it that, we might as well call it, ""Burning Itch.""",
CAAM019PH,CAAM,Phoebe,WHAT?! OOooooh! Rrrrr!,
CAAM020QU,CAAM,Quentin,"Hey, how's everybody tonight? You feelin' Itchy? I said, YOU FEELIN' ITCHY?",
CAAM021PH,CAAM,Phoebe,Watch it Quentin!,
CAAM022QU,CAAM,Quentin,Or what. You'll burn me? You know you can't burn me. You got a block. That's why we're friends.,
CAAM023PH,CAAM,Phoebe,Aw you're right.,
CAAM024QU,CAAM,Quentin,That's why we're in a band together.,
CAAM025PH,CAAM,Phoebe,Yeah...,
CAAM026QU,CAAM,Quentin,And why we should call our band The Levitators.,
CAAM027PH,CAAM,Phoebe,Did you say Heavy Taters? Cuz that's what I heard.,
CAAM028QU,CAAM,Quentin,Levitators!,
CAAM029PH,CAAM,Phoebe,Firestarters!,
CAAT001MF,CAAT,Maloof,Thanks. I thought I was stuck in there forever.,

CAAT005MF,CAAT,Maloof,Cool? Do you have any idea what this does?,
CAAT006RA,CAAT,Raz,Something cool?,
CAAT007MF,CAAT,Maloof,"Uh, no. It's a sixth-sensory deprivation tank. A hermetically sealed metaphysical hotbox.",
CAAT008MF,CAAT,Maloof,It's solitary confinement for psychics.,
CAAT009RA,CAAT,Raz,Naaaasty. And the Coach locked you inside it?,
CAAT010MF,CAAT,Maloof,Nah. The staff hasn't put any kids in the GPC since the 50's.,
CAAT011MF,CAAT,Maloof,Bobby threw me in here.,
CAAT012MH,CAAT,Mikhail,Bully and dwarf accomplice should assault own size or larger only.,
CAAT013MH,CAAT,Mikhail,"While in cooler, perhaps noticed gigantic bear with skin where hair should be?",
CAAT014MF,CAAT,Maloof,I didn't see anything in there. That's the whole point.,
CAAT015MH,CAAT,Mikhail,"Ah, just so. Empty now.",

CAAU022MH,CAAU,Mikhail,"In Russia, bears much smaller.",
CAAU023MH,CAAU,Mikhail,Also more hair. Less lurking. Always eager to wrestle.,
CAAU024MH,CAAU,Mikhail,This one hide and run.,
CAAU025RA,CAAU,Raz,I'll let you know if I see anything.,
CAAU026MH,CAAU,Mikhail,"Cannot lurk forever, bear.",
CAAV001KI,CAAV,Kitty,"Okay, you can pass.",
CAAV002KI,CAAV,Kitty,Didn't we tell you not to come back until you found an arrowhead?,
CAAV003FA,CAAV,Franke,No passing!,
CAAV004RA,CAAV,Raz,But I need to get to class.,
CAAV005FA,CAAV,Franke,Maybe you should have thought of that before.,
CAAV006RA,CAAV,Raz,I did think of that before. That's why I'm here now.,
CAAV007KI,CAAV,Kitty,Exactly. Now you gotta pay the toll.,
CAAV008FA,CAAV,Franke,One arrowhead.,
CAAV009KI,CAAV,Kitty,PAY UP!,
CAAV010RA,CAAV,Raz,I found this thing. Is that what you're talking about?,
CAAV011KI,CAAV,Kitty,"Yup, that's an arrowhead.",
CAAV012RA,CAAV,Raz,How'd they get here?,
CAAV013RA,CAAV,Raz,Arrowhead? What's that? Where do I get one?,
CAAV014KI,CAAV,Kitty,"Franke, the new kid can't be this dumb, right?",

CAAD003EL,CAAD,Elka,"And I thought, ""Oh Nils, when will you peek into the hole in my heart?""",
CAAD004EL,CAAD,Elka,Because you'd just see yourself staring back.,
CAAD005DO,CAAD,Dogen,Uh huh. What?,
CAAD006EL,CAAD,Elka,"I mean, he'd see my new boyfriend James staring back. And he'd be furious at Nils.",
CAAD007DO,CAAD,Dogen,Who's Nils?,

CAAG008EF,CAAG,Elton,No regular fish anyway.,
CAAG009EF,CAAG,Elton,"Hey, did it have enormous, glowing eyes by any chance?",
CAAG010EF,CAAG,Elton,And did it have a prehensile lure that it uses to attract and snare its prey?,

CAAQ006RA,CAAQ,Raz,Fish think? About what?,
CAAQ007EF,CAAQ,Elton,"Well, normally, not much. But today they're all kinda freaked.",
CAAQ008EF,CAAQ,Elton,They're scared of somethin' in the lake.,
CAAQ009RA,CAAQ,Raz,"Me too, now that I know it's full of freaked-out, thinking fish.",
CAAQ010EF,CAAQ,Elton,"There's something big and scary out there, Raz.",
CAAQ011EF,CAAQ,Elton,I wonder... could the old legends be true?,
CABA057VE,CABA,Vernon,"Okay. I'm gonna close my eyes, right? And then I'm gonna start to count to a hundred. Ok? And then you guys hide. Everybody got it?",
CABA058EL,CABA,Elka,"It's hide-and-seek, Vernon, not hide-and-calculus. We've all got it.",

CABI026RA,CABI,Raz,"Come on, things can't be that bad.  So you've got a jockstrap on your--",

CABI028MF,CABI,Maloof,"If any bears show up, feel free to cut right in. Anyway, it is that bad.  First Bobby and Benny locked me in the girls' shower, then they wouldn't let me out of the toilet, now they won't let me in any of the toilets. And in between, there was a lot of punching.",
CABI029BZ,CABI,Bobby,"No, then we locked you in the GPC.",

CAMV003CO,CAMV,Coach,"Hey, hey! You stay away from that egghead, you hear me?",
CAMV004RA,CAMV,Raz,"Egghead? Permission to speak freely, sir.",
CAMV005CO,CAMV,Coach,"Denied. Listen, Private, those scientific jokers, they don't know what it really means to be a Psychonaut. It's about being in the field, not cooped up in some underground lab all day!",
CAMV006RA,CAMV,Raz,It's underground? Ah ha!,
CAMV007CO,CAMV,Coach,Don't even think it! That Brain Tumbler contraption of his will turn your mind to mush! I need that brain!,
CAMV008CO,CAMV,Coach,"I mean, YOU need that brain.",
CAMV009CO,CAMV,Coach,"Now, dismissed soldier. I've got some serious thinking to do. Lots of important planning!",
CAMW010RA,CAMW,Raz,What kind of planning?,
CAMW011CO,CAMW,Coach,Huh? What?,
CAMW012RA,CAMW,Raz,What kind of planning are you doing there? In your sleep?,
CAMW013CO,CAMW,Coach,"Hey, never assume a soldier is sleeping just because his eyes are closed.",
CAMW014CO,CAMW,Coach,Trust me. That tip could save your life someday.,

CAMX023RA,CAMX,Raz,"Hey, Coach, what's Milla Vodello really like?",
CAMX024RA,CAMX,Raz,"Hey, Coach, in a life or death battle between Sasha Nein, and a great white shark, where the shark could see the future, and Sasha was blindfolded, who do you think--",
CAMX025CO,CAMX,Coach,"I told you, Private! I've got a lot of scheming to do here. You're dismissed!",
CAMY026RA,CAMY,Raz,"Hey, coach! I need to learn Levitation quick!",
CAMY027CO,CAMY,Coach,Do I look like a floater to you?,
CAMY028CO,CAMY,Coach,Vodello gives the Levitation drills out on the docks.,

CAPL001RA,CAPL,Raz,"Hey, Elka!",
CAPN004EL,CAPN,Elka,Why don't you and your little goggles go poke around in someone else's private business?,
CAPP001RA,CAPP,Raz,"Hey, you guys sound great!",
CAPP002JT,CAPP,J.T.,"Ha-huh, much obliged, pardner.",
CAQQ010NI,CAQQ,Nils,"Oh, YEAH.",
CAQQ011NI,CAQQ,Nils,This is going to be sweet.,
CAQQ012NI,CAQQ,Nils,"Man, I can see EVERYTHING.",
CAQR013RA,CAQR,Raz,"You know, a nutcracker might be faster.",
CAQR014NI,CAQR,Nils,"Tonight, when this baby is full of fine ladies, I'm going to see EVERYTHING.",
CAQR015RA,CAQR,Raz,How are you going to fill that nut with ladies?,
CAQR016NI,CAQR,Nils,"No, dude. The girls' cabin. I've got a man on the inside.",
CAQR017RA,CAQR,Raz,I get it! You're using Clairvoyance! You grabbed one of the squirrel's nuts and now you're using Clairvoyance on it to form a mental link and see what the squirrel sees!,
CAQR018NI,CAQR,Nils,"Um, could you say ""acorns"" instead of ""nuts"" if you repeat that to anybody else?",
CAQR019RA,CAQR,Raz,Teach me how to do that!,
CAQR020NI,CAQR,Nils,"Hey, I paid a LITTLE bit of attention in class, but not THAT much.",
CAQR021NI,CAQR,Nils,"What you need is an expert in Clairvoyance, where I am merely an expert in the ladies.",
CAQS022RA,CAQS,Raz,Come on! Teach me Clairvoyance.,
CAQS023NI,CAQS,Nils,Go find an expert! I have no idea how I'm doing this.,
CAQS024NI,CAQS,Nils,Now beat it. You're breaking my focus.,
CAAE016EL,CAAE,Elka,"Do you want to hear something that James--you know, my new boyfriend James--something funny he said?",
CAAE017NI,CAAE,Nils,No.,
CAAE018EL,CAAE,Elka,He said--,
CAAE019NI,CAAE,Nils,"I said, ""no.""",
CAAE020EL,CAAE,Elka,"Oh. Anyway, we were talking to Lili and she's all het up about a monster she thinks she saw in the woods.",
CAAE021NI,CAAE,Nils,Het up?,
CAAE022EL,CAAE,Elka,"It's Wild West for ""excited.""",
CAAE023EL,CAAE,Elka,"James and I spend so much time together, I guess I'm starting to sound like him.",
CAAE024NI,CAAE,Nils,"Funny, I talked to Lili last night and she didn't mention anything about a monster.",
CAAE025EL,CAAE,Elka,Nothing?,
CAAE026NI,CAAE,Nils,"Well, she mostly said ""mmm mmm mmm"" because we were letting our mouths do the talking, if you know what I mean.",
CAAE027EL,CAAE,Elka,I sure don't. What do you mean?,
CAAE028NI,CAAE,Nils,I mean we were making out because we're involved. Romantically.,
CAAE029EL,CAAE,Elka,WHAT? YOU--Wait--She doesn't like you that way.,
CAAE030EL,CAAE,Elka,"In fact, that's just one of the many ways she doesn't like you.",
CAAE031EL,CAAE,Elka,"In fact, she doesn't like you, period.",
CAAE032EL,CAAE,Elka,"You're lying about this whole thing, aren't you?",
CAAE033NI,CAAE,Nils,No way. Lili's my new girlfriend.,
CAAE034NI,CAAE,Nils,"Don't ask her though, because it's a secret.  Because... well, the ""because"" is a secret too.",
CAAE035EL,CAAE,Elka,"Oh Nils. I know it hurts, but I have a new boy in my life.",
CAAE036EL,CAAE,Elka,"A new cowboy. And he's not just a new cowboy, he's a cowman.",
CAAE037NI,CAAE,Nils,I think you have me confused with you.,
CAAE038NI,CAAE,Nils,I'm so moved on I wrapped around and now I'm back.,
CAAE039EL,CAAE,Elka,Whatever you say.,
CAAE040NI,CAAE,Nils,There's plenty of women where you came from. And other places.,
CAAE041EL,CAAE,Elka,Good.,
CAAR012RA,CAAR,Raz,"Hey Elton, have you heard anything else about that thing in the lake?",
CAAR013EF,CAAR,Elton,Huh? Oh. Not really. The fish are kinda goin' crazy about Bobby and Benny over there torturing anything that swims too close.,
CAAR014EF,CAAR,Elton,"Ohhh, somebody should do something.",
CAAR015MP,CAAR,Milka,Yeah!,
CAAR016RA,CAAR,Raz,"Well, I suppose I could go talk to them...",
CAAS017RA,CAAS,Raz,What are the chances that--if I ask nicely--you two will stop messing with those poor fish?,
CAAS018BZ,CAAS,Bobby,"About as good as the chance that if you say one more freakin' word to me about fish, the fire department's gonna have to Jaws of Life my fist outta your mouth!",
CAAS019RA,CAAS,Raz,"So wait, does that mean you will?",
CAAS020BZ,CAAS,Bobby,I will punch you. That's what that means.,
CAAS021MP,CAAS,Milka,I am the Hideous Hulking Lungfish of Lake Oblongata! I can breathe air and love to eat the brains of little boys.,
CAAS022BN,CAAS,Benny,AHHHH!,
CACO001VE,CACO,Vernon,Hey guys!,
CACO002KI,CACO,Kitty,Did you hear something Franke?,
CACO003FA,CACO,Franke,Nope.,
CACO004VE,CACO,Vernon,"Guys, hey! Hey! It's Vernon. I'm right next to you. Hey!",
CACO006FA,CACO,Franke,"What is it, Vernon?",
CACO007VE,CACO,Vernon,"Have you guys seen Dogen or Elka or Milka? We were playing hide-and-seek and--it's actually a funny story... I said, ""I'll count to a hundred."" and then--",
CACO008KI,CACO,Kitty,Stop! We saw them. We saw all of them. Just like five seconds ago.,
CACO009FA,CACO,Franke,"They were headed towards that place, the one that's so far away.",
CACO010VE,CACO,Vernon,The beach?,
CACO011KI,CACO,Kitty,"No, that's too close...",
CACO012KI,CACO,Kitty,The woods! The really far woods.,
CACO013VE,CACO,Vernon,Thanks!,
CABH020EF,CABH,Elton,That was rad!,
CABH022EF,CABH,Elton,"You're pretty rad, too.",
CAMO030RA,CAMO,Raz,What're you doing?,
CAMO031CH,CAMO,Chloe,"To contact anything beyond your planet's moon, we need a bigger antenna.",
CAMP032RA,CAMP,Raz,Can I help?,
CAMP033CH,CAMP,Chloe,Affirmative. Step aside and do not touch anything. And stop talking.,
CAMR002RA,CAMR,Raz,Did you find that bear?,
CAMR003MH,CAMR,Mikhail,Nyet. Soon. Woods not big enough for me and summer camp and giant bear.,
CAMS004RA,CAMS,Raz,"I saw something in the woods, too. I don't think it's a bear, Mikhail.",
CAMS005MH,CAMS,Mikhail,Agreed. Could be ape escaped from zoo or bigfoot. Same result: wrestled into submission.,
CAMT006RA,CAMT,Raz,I think it's some kind of a walking fish thing.,
CAMT007MH,CAMT,Mikhail,Fish? Is this joke? It is funny.,
CAMU008RA,CAMU,Raz,"I'm serious, Mikhail. I think that bear is a fish.",
CAMU009MH,CAMU,Mikhail,Okay. Joke is over.,
CAMU010RA,CAMU,Raz,"Hey, Mikhail, what's up?",
CAMU011MH,CAMU,Mikhail,Nothing. Busy now.,
CAPU011RA,CAPU,Raz,Great shot!,
CAPU012JT,CAPU,J.T.,"Well, pardner, it weren't ""great."" But t'weren't bad, neither.",
CAPV013RA,CAPV,Raz,"Wow, that's awesome!",
CAPV014JT,CAPV,J.T.,"Stand back, greenhorn, or yer gonna git a nasty hotfoot.",
CAAJ001BN,CAAJ,Benny,RRRRR! Lemme go!,
CAAJ002MH,CAAJ,Mikhail,What to do with small bully assistant?,
CAAJ003MF,CAAJ,Maloof,"Jeez, I don't know. Could you put him in that ""Deadly Nelson"" you were talking about?",
CAAJ004MH,CAAJ,Mikhail,"Could. On such tiny opponent, all blood might drain out earholes.",
CAAJ005BN,CAAJ,Benny,AHHHHH!,
CAAJ006MF,CAAJ,Maloof,"Shut up, Benny!",
CAAJ007MH,CAAJ,Mikhail,"On other hand, blood from constricted trunk could rush to tongue.",
CAAJ008MF,CAAJ,Maloof,And?,
CAAJ009MH,CAAJ,Mikhail,"Tongue swells, pops. Most blood drains back down throat.",
CAAJ010MF,CAAJ,Maloof,Interesting.,
CAAJ011MH,CAAJ,Mikhail,Less mess that way. Mouth stuffed with giant tongue can't scream--so quieter.,
CAAJ013MF,CAAJ,Maloof,"Shut up, Benny.",
CAAJ014MF,CAAJ,Maloof,You have something less drastic?,
CAAJ015MH,CAAJ,Mikhail,Could use Half Deadly Nelson.,
CAAJ016MF,CAAJ,Maloof,What's that?,
CAAJ017MH,CAAJ,Mikhail,Like Deadly Nelson but less dying.,
CAAJ018MF,CAAJ,Maloof,How much less?,
CAAJ019MH,CAAJ,Mikhail,Half.,
CAAJ020MF,CAAJ,Maloof,What happens the other half of the time?,
CAAJ021MH,CAAJ,Mikhail,"Opponent lives, spends rest of short life praying for death.",
CAAJ022BN,CAAJ,Benny,HEY! Can you hear me down there? Maloof?,
CAAJ024BN,CAAJ,Benny,"Seriously, Maloof, I apologize. Call off your goon and I'll never bother you again. Ever.",
CAAJ025MF,CAAJ,Maloof,"The thing is, Benny, you're never gonna bother me again either way.",
CAAJ026MF,CAAJ,Maloof,So you're gonna have to offer something a lot better than that.,
CAAJ027BN,CAAJ,Benny,Like what?,
CAAJ028MF,CAAJ,Maloof,"Any ideas, Mikhail?",
CAAJ029MH,CAAJ,Mikhail,"Know anything about giant, hairless bear?",
CAAJ030BN,CAAJ,Benny,No...,
CAAJ031MH,CAAJ,Mikhail,Out of ideas. Preparing Nelson.,
CAAJ032BN,CAAJ,Benny,"Well wait! Wait! Uh, maybe--uh, yeah, m--maybe I did see something like that. Give me a minute to think.",
CAAJ033MF,CAAJ,Maloof,"You ready to talk, Benny?",
CAAJ034BN,CAAJ,Benny,Hold on. It'll come to me.,
CAAK035MF,CAAK,Maloof,"Hey, Raz. You mind coming back later? We're taking care of a little business.",
CAAO001VE,CAAO,Vernon,Did you ladies know one of the bloodiest battles of the Civil War was fought on the shore of this very lake?,
CAAO002VE,CAAO,Vernon,"Yup, it's true.",
CAAO003VE,CAAO,Vernon,It happened back when this place was still an Indian summer camp and burial ground.,
CAAO004VE,CAAO,Vernon,A group of Union soldiers got separated from their regiment.,
CAAO005VE,CAAO,Vernon,Night was falling and they were cold and scared... Of Dracula! BOO! Huh-hahaha!,
CAAO006VE,CAAO,Vernon,"Uhm, I'm kidding. They were just terrified of getting shot.",
CAAO007VE,CAAO,Vernon,Though I'm sure any of them with any sense were afraid of Dracula too.,
CAAO008VE,CAAO,Vernon,They stumbled across an old building--you can still see it on the far side of the lake.,
CAAO009VE,CAAO,Vernon,So they decided to spend the night there.,
CAAO010VE,CAAO,Vernon,Little did they know it was...,
CAAO011VE,CAAO,Vernon,An abandoned Indian insane asylum built on a caveman burial ground!,
CAAO012VE,CAAO,Vernon,Little did they also know that a cursed fish lived in the asylum.,
CAAO013VE,CAAO,Vernon,And that he was an escaped lunatic.,
CAAO014VE,CAAO,Vernon,But from a different asylum.,
CAAO015VE,CAAO,Vernon,"So even though he was actually living in an asylum, he was still counted as escaped.",
CAAO016VE,CAAO,Vernon,And what was his curse you ask?,
CAAO017VE,CAAO,Vernon,Where his gills should have been...,
CAAO018VE,CAAO,Vernon,He. Had. Hooks!,
CAAO019VE,CAAO,Vernon,"Yup, and where one of the hooks should have been...",
CAAO020VE,CAAO,Vernon,He. Had. A. Lung! Yup... a lung!,
CAAO021VE,CAAO,Vernon,And instead of being about fourteen inches long.,
CAAO022VE,CAAO,Vernon,He. Was. Ten. Feet. Tall.,
CAAO023VE,CAAO,Vernon,But that wasn't the scariest thing.,
CAAO024VE,CAAO,Vernon,The scariest thing...,
CAAO025VE,CAAO,Vernon,The absolute scariest thing...,
CAAO026VE,CAAO,Vernon,And the thing that still makes the old timers' blood turn to ice and vice versa...,
CAAO027VE,CAAO,Vernon,Is the part I said first about how he had hooks for gills.,
CAAO028VE,CAAO,Vernon,Oh Brrrrrr.,
CAAO029VE,CAAO,Vernon,"Uh, anybody need a hug?",
CAAO030VE,CAAO,Vernon,Anybody?,
CAAO031VE,CAAO,Vernon,No?,
CAAO032VE,CAAO,Vernon,"Okay, then. Anybody mind if I tell that story again?",
CAAO033VE,CAAO,Vernon,Speak up now if you don't want to hear it again.,
CAAO034VE,CAAO,Vernon,Here we go...,
CAAP035VE,CAAP,Vernon,"Not now, Raz, I'm in the middle of a story.",
CABB001FA,CABB,Franke,TeeeVeee.,
CABB002KI,CABB,Kitty,Hackey saaaaaack...,
CABB003VE,CABB,Vernon,"Yesss, hackey saaaack.",
CABB004RA,CABB,Raz,Oh no! They're all brainless!,
CABB005VE,CABB,Vernon,Hi Raz!,
CABB006RA,CABB,Raz,Vernon! You're okay!,
CABB007VE,CABB,Vernon,"Yeah, we're great. Me and my pals Kitty and Franke are just hanging out tellin' stories and watchin' the boob tube.",
CABB008KI,CABB,Kitty,TeeeVeeeee.,
CABB009RA,CABB,Raz,"Vernon, look at them. They're zombies.",
CABB010VE,CABB,Vernon,It did seem kind of weird when they let me get this close to them.,
CABB011VE,CABB,Vernon,And then they didn't mind when I talked all through the show.,
CABB012VE,CABB,Vernon,Kitty even agreed to go on a date with me more or less--we're gonna play hackey sack!,
CABB013RA,CABB,Raz,Keep an eye on them Vernon.,
CABB014RA,CABB,Raz,I'm gonna go figure out what's causing this!,
CABB015VE,CABB,Vernon,"Roger that, Raz.",
CABE001EL,CABE,Elka,"I don't care how long you two have been ""pardners."" James is my boyfriend now. Do you know what that means?",
CABE002CP,CABE,Chops,"Uh, well, he wears his good parade chaps a lot more.",
CABE003EL,CABE,Elka,"Yes, he's less filthy. That's part of it.",
CABE004EL,CABE,Elka,But the biggest change is that he can't possibly waste as much time as he used to hanging out with his loser friends.,
CABE005CP,CABE,Chops,I don't like you.,
CABE006EL,CABE,Elka,And I don't like you. So that covers everything we have in common.,
CABE007EL,CABE,Elka,Now for the differences: I'm going to be with James all the time from now on.,
CABE008EL,CABE,Elka,You're going to have to stay as far away from us as possible or I'm going to make your life more miserable than I imagine it already is.,
CABF009LI,CABF,Lili,"I can't quite make it out, but something... something coming out of those speakers reminds me of my nightmare.",
CABF200RA,CABF,Raz,What are you listening to?,
CABG010NI,CABG,Nils,"You know Chloe, for a chick whose face I can't see because she's always wearing a helmet, you're pretty cute.",
CABG011CH,CABG,Chloe,"I'm not human, earth primate.",
CABG012NI,CABG,Nils,"But you are the girl model of whatever it is you are, right?",
CABG013CH,CABG,Chloe,Affirmative.,
CABG014NI,CABG,Nils,"At this point, that's totally close enough.",
CABG015BZ,CABG,Bobby,"Man, what smells like butt? Oh, hey Nils.  How 'bout you and your butt and its odor take a hike before I puke?",
CABG016NI,CABG,Nils,But...,
CABG017BZ,CABG,Bobby,It'd be a real shame if you had to leave your butt here because it was anchored to my foot. NOW BEAT IT!,
CABG018BZ,CABG,Bobby,"Hi Chloe.  How's it... I mean... You know, what's up and stuff?",
CABG019CH,CABG,Chloe,"Bobby, we need to work on you a little.",
CAMF001CF,CAMF,Crystal,So this is it.,
CAMF002CM,CAMF,Clem,Yep.,
CAMF003CF,CAMF,Crystal,I'm so happy Clem.,
CAMF004CM,CAMF,Clem,"Me too, Crystal.",
CAMF005CF,CAMF,Crystal,It's going to be great isn't it?,
CAMF006CM,CAMF,Clem,Super great.,
CAMF007CF,CAMF,Crystal,"We're going to be so powerful, aren't we?",
CAMF008CM,CAMF,Clem,More powerful than you can imagine.,
CAMF009CF,CAMF,Crystal,Sigh. I can't wait.,
CAMF010CF,CAMF,Crystal,"The sunset's beautiful, isn't it?",
CAMF011CM,CAMF,Clem,It will be more beautiful afterwards.,
CAMF012CF,CAMF,Crystal,When we've done what we're going to do.,
CAMF013CM,CAMF,Clem,Yes. When we've finished the project.,
CAMF014CF,CAMF,Crystal,"The people down there look like ants, don't they?",
CAMF015CM,CAMF,Clem,"They are ants, Crystal. Cruel, cruel little ants.",
CAMF016CF,CAMF,Crystal,"Oh, Clem. It's not their fault.",
CAMF017CM,CAMF,Clem,"Still, they're gonna be sorry.",
CAMF018CF,CAMF,Crystal,"Yes, that's true. They will all be sorry.",
CAMF019CF,CAMF,Crystal,Hey is that Nils down there with Chloe?,
CAMF020CM,CAMF,Clem,Whoa. That's weird.,
CAMF021CF,CAMF,Crystal,"Oh, man. I've got to tell Elka.",
CAMF022CM,CAMF,Clem,What's the point?,
CAMF023CF,CAMF,Crystal,"I guess soon there won't be much point to any of this, will there?",
CAMF024CM,CAMF,Clem,Not when we've finished...,
CAMF025CF,CAMF,Crystal,The project.,
CAMF026CM,CAMF,Clem,Yes.,
CAMF027CF,CAMF,Crystal,You hear about Elton and Milka?,
CAMF028CM,CAMF,Clem,"No, what?",
CAMF029CF,CAMF,Crystal,Totally a couple now.,
CAMF030CM,CAMF,Clem,No way. I thought Elton loved Lili?,
CAMF031CF,CAMF,Crystal,"Shyeah, well, and I thought Milka loved Quentin.",
CAMF032CM,CAMF,Clem,"Well, I guess if peoples' love was something you could trust, we wouldn't be here now, would we?",
CAMF033CF,CAMF,Crystal,"Good point as always, Clem.",
CAMF034CM,CAMF,Clem,"Well, are you ready?",
CAMF035CF,CAMF,Crystal,Just one more minute.,
CAMF036CF,CAMF,Crystal,Let's just watch the sun until it sets.,
CAMF037CM,CAMF,Clem,All right. Let's let people have one last sunset before things change forever.,
CAMF038CF,CAMF,Crystal,...forever...,
CAMG039RA,CAMG,Raz,Hey did I hear you guy's writing another cheer?,
CAMG040CF,CAMG,Crystal,Um...,

CACQ003MF,CACQ,Maloof,"But once you're in, you can use these Smelling Salts to sneak out.",
CACQ004MF,CACQ,Maloof,"Take mine. I don't need them anymore. I'm calling my parents to come get me, before I get hurt.",
CACQ005BZ,CACQ,Bobby,Too late!,

CACU000RA,CACU,Raz,This button look familiar to you?,
CACU001VE,CACU,Vernon,"Oh, man. That's from the Geodesic Psychoisolation Chamber. That reminds me of this time I was stuck in there for three days straight. The first ten minutes weren't bad, but then the second five were pretty scary. I was delirious for the three after that. And then--",
CACU002RA,CACU,Raz,"Hey, I think I see Elka over there!",
CACU003VE,CACU,Vernon,Where?,
CACV000RA,CACV,Raz,I think this button is a clue to the location of Sasha Nein's secret lab.,

CACY000RA,CACY,Raz,"Hey, look at this button I found on Nils' bunk.",
CACY001RA,CACY,Raz,It looks like it came off a girl's dress.,
CACY003EL,CACY,Elka,I don't care.,
CACY004RA,CACY,Raz,Looks like it was just torn off by force!,
CACY005RA,CACY,Raz,It's got little teeth marks on it!,
CACY006EL,CACY,Elka,GET THAT THING OUT OF MY FACE BEFORE I SHOVE IT IN YOUR EYE SOCKET AND SEW IT TO YOUR BRAIN!,
CACY007DO,CACY,Dogen,Nils kisses girls on the mouth and likes it.,
CACY008EL,CACY,Elka,"Why don't you just take off your hat and kill me, Dogen?",
CACY009DO,CACY,Dogen,I dunno.,
CACZ000RA,CACZ,Raz,But I need to get to Sasha Nein's secret lab!,

CADC002RA,CADC,Raz,Again with the girlfriend thing. Listen--,
CADC003MH,CADC,Mikhail,"Hey, just kidding. Mikhail know women good for only one thing!",
CADC005MH,CADC,Mikhail,Unless have skinny arms like your girlfriend. Then out of luck.,

CADE007LI,CADE,Lili,"Mm, no.",
CADF000RA,CADF,Raz,"Hey, if you were going to make a friendship bracelet, you could maybe use this button here.",
CADF001LI,CADF,Lili,Why? So you could unbutton it and take it off when you got tired of being friends with me? ,
CADF002RA,CADF,Raz,Who said you were making it for me?,
CADF003LI,CADF,Lili,Uhhh--,
CADF004LI,CADF,Lili,"You know, if you were going to shut up, you could use that button on your lip. How about that?",

CADI000JT,CADI,J.T.,"Hey, you're that new kid, ain't ya?",
CADI001RA,CADI,Raz,"Well, I'm doing some advanced training right now as a matter of fact, so I don't think ""New Kid"" is really a name that you want to get too used to saying.",
CADI002CP,CADI,Chops,"Hold on there. You're not doing Sasha Nein's advanced training that he does in his secret, underground lab are you?",
CADI003CP,CADI,Chops,Hidden deep within the iron walls of the GPC where no one can hear you screaming?,

CADL000RA,CADL,Raz,"Hey, look, Chloe. I found a tiny, red space ship.",
CADL001CH,CADL,Chloe,"Nice fake Trynaxian Cruiser, Raz. But if you'd done even the most basic research, you'd know that real Trynaxian Cruisers have SIX viewports on top, not four.",
CADL002RA,CADL,Raz,Well I guess you just haven't seen THIS YEAR'S Trynaxian Cruiser then.,
CADL003CH,CADL,Chloe,The Trynaxian galaxy exploded 400 years ago.,
CADL004RA,CADL,Raz,Oh my god. This must be really valuable then. ,

CADU000RA,CADU,Raz,What can I buy with this button?,
CADU001FO,CADU,Ford,"We only take arrowheads here, kid. ",
CADU002FO,CADU,Ford,100% pure Psitanium arrowheads. Squeezed from the ground like magical pimples popped out of Mother Earth's own back.,

CADV000RA,CADV,Raz,"Okay, here's my Oarsman's Badge.",
CADV001FO,CADV,Ford,"I'm not THAT blind, you little rat. Now beat it until you get the real thing.",

CADX000RA,CADX,Raz,"Hey, do you know where this button belongs?",
CADX001FO,CADX,Ford,I know where it DOESN'T belong. It doesn't belong HERE in these off-limit woods! Just like you. Now g--,
CADX002FO,CADX,Ford,Oh. Wait. That's from the GPC. It DOES belong down here in these off-limit woods. Hmmm.,
CADX003FO,CADX,Ford,But you don't! So git!,
CADY001VE,CADY,Vernon,"Well, I tracked Dogen into the forest, but his footprints just... disappeared.",
CADY002RA,CADY,Raz,Really?,
CADY003VE,CADY,Vernon,"Yeah, and I tried to tag Elka, but she punched me.",
CADY004VE,CADY,Vernon,"I saw Milka run into this cave, so all I have to do now is wait.",
CADY005RA,CADY,Raz,Why don't you just run in there?,
CADY006VE,CADY,Vernon,"Never follow a snake into its hole, Raz. That is the code of the mongoose. The code of the hunter.",
CADY007RA,CADY,Raz,How's it going Mongoose?,
CADY008VE,CADY,Vernon,Everything is falling into place. We're moving into the endgame.,
CADZ000RA,CADZ,Raz,Dogen!,
CADZ001RA,CADZ,Raz,"Yeah, good idea. You rest here while I find your brains!",

CAEA005MF,CAEA,Maloof,"A lot of things are going to change around here, Razputin.",
CAEA006MF,CAEA,Maloof,A power shift. Some big figures will be going down. Some new stars rising. ,

CAEG003MI,CAEG,Milla,"Dogen's not in the lab, sweetie. He's watching TV in the lodge with the other children.",
CAEG004RA,CAEG,Raz,"I meant the dream Dogen from my Brain Tumbler vision. If I can find out what's happening to him, maybe that would give me a clue about who stole real Dogen's brain.",
CAEG005MI,CAEG,Milla,"Oh, I'm afraid he's just like that.",
CAEH000RA,CAEH,Raz,"Excuse me, Agent Vodello?",
CAEH001MI,CAEH,Milla,"Hello, darling. Are you back for another dance?",

CAEV000DO,CAEV,Dogen,...and so I'm really sorry for not believing you.,
CAEV001DO,CAEV,Dogen,"...right, yeah--that too. I should really not have blown so many of you up. I just get so confused sometimes.",

CAFH001RA,CAFH,Raz,What? Why'd you throw yourself off the roof?,
CAFH002CF,CAFH,Crystal,Because the poison didn't work!,
CAFH003CF,CAFH,Crystal,"Listen, I have to go. The world could use some major league cheering right about now!",
CAFI000JT,CAFI,J.T.,Well shut mah mouth. I'd better go patrol the livin' quarters. Guard the womenfolk 'n' all.,
CAFI001JT,CAFI,J.T.,"Say, is my hombre walking around yet?",
CAFI002RA,CAFI,Raz,"Not yet, but soon!",
CAFI003JT,CAFI,J.T.,I just hope he forgives me for actin' like such a dang fool.,

CAFM000CP,CAFM,Chops,"You know, I'll bet if J.T. wasn't so distracted, this wouldn't have happened. ",
CAFM001CP,CAFM,Chops,He's probably with that prissy little show pony right now.,
CAFM002RA,CAFM,Raz,"No, actually I think her mind's on other things at the moment.",
CAFM003CP,CAFM,Chops,Hm. Well maybe I'll go see what's up. One of us at least should be guarding the sleeping quarters.,
CAFN000CH,CAFN,Chloe,"Okay, here's the plan. I'm going to get on the Coach's radio, and call for help.",
CAFN001RA,CAFN,Raz,"See, now, that's an excellent idea! Why can't everyone be so helpful?",
CAFN002CH,CAFN,Chloe,"Yeah, I modified the antenna so now it broadcasts straight into outer space!",

CAFX003FO,CAFX,Ford,"Well, I know just what to do!",
CAFX004RA,CAFX,Raz,You do? Great!,
CAFX005FO,CAFX,Ford,"Yeah, I've got some lungfish-proof shellac. I'll just slap on a fresh coat, maybe two, and that's that!",
CAFX006RA,CAFX,Raz,"Admiral, the monster is still out there, and Coach Oleander is trying to take over the world!",
CAFX007FO,CAFX,Ford,"Ah, yes, the world is a crazy place, son. But don't worry.",
CAFX008FO,CAFX,Ford,The canoes are safe.,

CAFY001FO,CAFY,Ford,"Well, now you see what happens when you go to parts of the forest that are off limits? ",
CAFY002FO,CAFY,Ford,I'm a Ranger. I've got enough problems wrangling these leaves! Now git!,
CAFZ000DO,CAFZ,Dogen,"Wow, I guess that's what those squirrels were trying to tell me.",
CAFZ001RA,CAFZ,Raz,Huh?,
CAFZ002DO,CAFZ,Dogen,"They kept saying, ""The tiny man is going to kill everyone.""",
CAFZ003DO,CAFZ,Dogen,I thought they were talking about me!,
CAFZ004DO,CAFZ,Dogen,Oh man. I have to go apologize.,
CADD005RA,CADD,Raz,Hmm. Looks like one of the buttons is missing.,

CAGA006FO,CAGA,Ford,Over there.,
CAGA007FO,CAGA,Ford,"Clocks a-tickin', Sonny!",
CAGA008RA,CAGA,Raz,"Wow, what's that?",
CAGA009FO,CAGA,Ford,That's a PSI CHALLENGE MARKER. The staff scatters these all over the camp to test the students. Every one of these you find advances you a whole rank.,
CAGA010RA,CAGA,Raz,Ah ha...,
CAGA011FO,CAGA,Ford,"Now, look up for me if you will.",
CAZE006TO,CAZE,System,Move right thumbstick [vertical joystick icon] to look up.,

CAGA014FO,CAGA,Ford,Come on.,
CAGA015FO,CAGA,Ford,You see where I'm pointing?,
CAGA016RA,CAGA,Raz,Hmmm,
CAGA017FO,CAGA,Ford,Some of the old markers have fallen apart. You'll find bits of 'em flapping around loose.,
CAGA018FO,CAGA,Ford,"If you find enough of these PSI CARDS, you can put 'em together to make a brand new Challenge Marker...",
CAGA019FO,CAGA,Ford,...But you have to buy a PSI CORE at the camp store to hold them together.,
CAGA020FO,CAGA,Ford,Keep ranking up and before you know it you'll be able to use brand new psychic powers. Stuff you didn't even know you could do. ,
CAGA021RA,CAGA,Raz,And then when do I become a Psychonaut? ,
CAGA022RA,CAGA,Raz,Because I have to do that before my dad shows up to take me home...,
CAGA023RA,CAGA,Raz,"Hey, where'd he go?",
CAGA024RA,CAGA,Raz,That guy looked so familiar...,
CAGB000VE,CAGB,Vernon,"Hey, why are you trying to firestart me, Raz?",

CAGB014CH,CAGB,Chloe,Hm. Atmospheric changes in effect. Adjusting helmet thermostat.,
CAGB015BZ,CAGB,Bobby,"Man, what is that smell?",
CAGB016BN,CAGB,Benny,My ears are burning. Kitty must be talking about me!,
CAGB017EF,CAGB,Elton,Oh man. I hope I don't get much hotter. That would be uncomfortable.,
CAGB018PH,CAGB,Phoebe,Oh no. Is my problem back? Have to calm down. Can't burn anything. Cannot burn anything!,
CAGB019QU,CAGB,Quentin,"Ooh, feels like Phoebe's having another flare up!",
CAGB020SA,CAGB,Sasha,"I'm sure you could find a more productive use for that skill, Razputin.",
CAGB021MI,CAGB,Milla,"Please, this is polyester. I'm hot enough!",

CAGC003DO,CAGC,Dogen,I'm not supposed to get wild at camp!,
CAGC004MP,CAGC,Milka,Grrrr!,
CAGC005KI,CAGC,Kitty,"Hey, put me down or my dad will sue your whole family!",
CAGC006FA,CAGC,Franke,Put me down or Kitty's dad will sue your whole family!,
CAGC007MH,CAGC,Mikhail,"Hm. Thanks for the boost. But no, still can see no bears from up here.",
CAGC008MF,CAGC,Maloof,"What are you trying to prove, Raz?",

CAGD025FO,CAGD,Ford,Stop starin' at my mops!,
CAGD026FO,CAGD,Ford,"You will call me ADMIRAL, Sonny!",
CAGD027CO,CAGD,Coach,"Oooh-ooooh... Mr. Bun, where you going? Ohhhh",
CAGE000RA,CAGE,Raz,Hey can I buy some stuff?,
CAGE001FO,CAGE,Ford,"Yeah, but hurry up. I don't want to burn my burgers. ",
GLZB013TO,GLZB,System,Dream Fluff,
CAGE003FO,CAGE,Ford,"Mmmm. Dream Fluffs! Delicious, nutritious and cheap!",
CAGE004FO,CAGE,Ford,Each one is packed with concentrated mental health!,
CAGE005FO,CAGE,Ford,You shouldn't go anywhere without a pocket full of those!,
GLZB014TO,GLZB,System,PSI Core,
CAGE007FO,CAGE,Ford,Now you take that PSI CORE there...,
CAGE008FO,CAGE,Ford,"Put it together with nine PSI CARDS, and you'll have yourself a brand new PSI Challenge Marker!",
CAGE009FO,CAGE,Ford,"Which is worth a whole rank, you know.",
GLZB015TO,GLZB,System,Cobweb Duster,
GLZH019TO,GLZH,System,Rank requirement: 15,
CAGE012FO,CAGE,Ford,Oh that's my last Cobweb Duster.,
CAGE013FO,CAGE,Ford,"Take that into someone's mind with ya, you can clean up!",
CAGE014FO,CAGE,Ford,"They're happy to be rid of the webs, and you can turn them in for PSI Cards!",
GLZB016TO,GLZB,System,Dowsing Rod,
GLZH020TO,GLZH,System,Rank Requirement: 10,
CAGE017FO,CAGE,Ford,Now that Dowsing Rod will help you find arrowheads that are buried DEEP.,
CAGE018FO,CAGE,Ford,"That's where all the really valuable ones are, you know. ",
CAGE019FO,CAGE,Ford,Find three or four deep deposits and that baby pays for itself.,
CAGE020FO,CAGE,Ford,It costs you money because it MAKES you money!,
GLZB017TO,GLZB,System,PSI Energy Colorizer,
GLZH021TO,GLZH,System,Rank Requirement: 40,
CAGE023FO,CAGE,Ford,"Now with that, you can change the color of some of your PSI powers, like your Levitation Ball, and what have you and whatnot.",
CAGE024FO,CAGE,Ford,"Well. kind of a vanity thing. In my day PSI powers were all gray and we thought that was grand. We were happy just to HAVE PSI powers. Ah, but you know kids these days.",
CAZB004TO,CAZB,System,Posters,
CAGE026FO,CAGE,Ford,"Eh, got some posters here.",
CAGE027FO,CAGE,Ford,You can hang 'em in your cabin.,

CAGE029RA,CAGE,Raz,"Hey, can you put that on my tab?",
CAGE030FO,CAGE,Ford,"Ah, sorry, mac. No can do. We only trade in hard, cold, Psitanium Arrowheads here.",
CAGE031FO,CAGE,Ford,"If you don't have enough, why don't you run around outside a bit and dig some up?",
CAGE032FO,CAGE,Ford,Or crack open some mental vaults. Always something valuable in a vault!,
CAGE033RA,CAGE,Raz,I don't have enough arrowheads for that!,
CAGE034FO,CAGE,Ford,"Well then, quit lookin' at it!",
CAGE035FO,CAGE,Ford,"Ah, it doesn't look like you've got the rank you need there, kiddo.",
CAGE036FO,CAGE,Ford,And there's no excuse for that! Plenty of ways to get promoted around here!,
CAGE037FO,CAGE,Ford,"Collecting mental figments and cobwebs helps you rank up. So does finding PSI challenge markers, or building them out of PSI cards and cores.",
CAGE038FO,CAGE,Ford,"You also rank up when you sort people's emotional baggage, and if you want to skip a bunch of ranks at once, well you should talk to the camp Ranger about his Scavenger Hunt contest.",
CAGE039RA,CAGE,Raz,I don't have a high enough rank to buy that yet!,
CAGE040FO,CAGE,Ford,Not yet. But maybe in a few years.,
CAGE041RA,CAGE,Raz,I'll take it!,
CAGE042FO,CAGE,Ford,Alrighty then. ,
CAGE043FO,CAGE,Ford,Excellent choice!,
CAGE044FO,CAGE,Ford,Sold! To the big-headed kid with the gloves!,

CAGF002BY,CAGF,Minecart-System,"Would you like to go back to your private sanctuary now, Agent Cruller? Or... somewhere else?",
CAGF003BY,CAGF,Minecart-System,"Where would you like me to take you, Agent Cruller?",

CAGF005BY,CAGF,Minecart-System,With pleasure.,
CAGF006RA,CAGF,Raz,Drop me outside the main lodge.,
CAGF007BY,CAGF,Minecart-System,"Oh, bring me back a burger this time, will you?",
CAGF008RA,CAGF,Raz,I'm headed for the parking lot.,
CAGF009BY,CAGF,Minecart-System,"I hope you're not leaving us, sir.",
CAGF010RA,CAGF,Raz,I want to go to the campfire area.,
CAGF011BY,CAGF,Minecart-System,Mmm. You look so cute in that janitor outfit!,
CAGF012RA,CAGF,Raz,"Let's go to Ford's--I mean, MY sanctuary.",
CAGF013BY,CAGF,Minecart-System,"Yes, noble Psychomaster.",
CAGF014RA,CAGF,Raz,It's time to go to the lake!,
CAGF015BY,CAGF,Minecart-System,"Yessir, Admiral Sir!",
CAGF016RA,CAGF,Raz,Bring me near the Geodesic Psychoisolation Chamber.,
CAGF017BY,CAGF,Minecart-System,"Roger that, Ranger Cruller!",
CAGF018RA,CAGF,Raz,Nowhere! I just like to come down here to hear your voice.,
CAGF019BY,CAGF,Minecart-System,"Pop in anytime, sir.",
CAGG000SA,CAGG,Sasha,Is that the cleaning lady? ,
CAGG001SA,CAGG,Sasha,"I'll get those files out of your way, just as soon as I'm done with these... tests...",
CAGG002SA,CAGG,Sasha,"Ah, yes. Thank you Razputin, for helping me clean up.",
CAGH000RA,CAGH,Raz,Is this going to hurt?,
CAGH001RA,CAGH,Raz,Have you tested this thing out on humans yet?,
CAGH002RA,CAGH,Raz,Will I get in trouble with Milla? She told me not to take any paranormal training while I'm here.,
CAGH003RA,CAGH,Raz,Could you try it first?,
CAGH004RA,CAGH,Raz,"Okay, I'm ready to learn how to really fight!",
CAGH005SA,CAGH,Sasha,Oh. Really? Hm.,
CAGH006RA,CAGH,Raz,What?,
CAGH007SA,CAGH,Sasha,"Uh, nothing. It's just that I didn't think you'd really take me up on that offer. It usually scares the kids off.",
CAGH008RA,CAGH,Raz,"Well, not me. I'm ready to kill for my camp!",
CAGH009SA,CAGH,Sasha,"Listen, I'm sorry, but I can't train you. Agent Vodello would kill me.",
CAGH010RA,CAGH,Raz,What's the big deal? What she doesn't know won't hurt her.,
CAGH011SA,CAGH,Sasha,You don't even have a Marksmanship Learner's Permit. I could lose my job!,
CAGH012RA,CAGH,Raz,I'll get one!,
CAGH013SA,CAGH,Sasha,Even if you used that secret passage over there and snuck into his sanctuary...,
CAGH014SA,CAGH,Sasha,Agent Cruller would never give you a Marksmanship Learner's permit.,
CAGH015RA,CAGH,Raz,Agent Cruller...,
CAGH016SA,CAGH,Sasha,Never in a million--,
CAGH017RA,CAGH,Raz,I'm off! Be right back after I talk with Agent Cruller!,
CAGH018SA,CAGH,Sasha,Did you convince Agent Cruller to give you a Marksmanship Learner's Permit yet?,
CAGH019RA,CAGH,Raz,Oh... uh... yes. But I left it in my other pants. Be right back.,
CAGH020RA,CAGH,Raz,Okay I got it. Check it out.,
CAGH021SA,CAGH,Sasha,Well my ass is covered.,
CAGH022SA,CAGH,Sasha,Are you sure you are ready to do this? It could be dangerous.,
CAGH023RA,CAGH,Raz,Yes! Are you going to pull me into your mind like the Coach did?,
CAGH024SA,CAGH,Sasha,"Ha. No offense, but it's time you saw what an organized mind looks like.",
CAGH025RA,CAGH,Raz,Almost! I just have to get my affairs in order first.,
CAGH026RA,CAGH,Raz,Just in case I die.,
CAGH027SA,CAGH,Sasha,Come back when you are ready.,
CAGH028RA,CAGH,Raz,"Okay, time to face my big, diving-helmet spitting personal demons.",
CAGH029SA,CAGH,Sasha,That's the spirit.,
CAGH030RA,CAGH,Raz,"Okay, I'm a certified levitator now. Ready to roll. ",
CAGH031SA,CAGH,Sasha,Hmm.,
CAGH032SA,CAGH,Sasha,I've been running some tests. It seems that the sensitive circuitry of the Brain Tumbler is picking up too much psychic interference to be safe. ,
CAGH033SA,CAGH,Sasha,"The thoughts of some other entity are interlacing with yours at a dangerous level, which explains many of the strange things you've seen.",
CAGH034SA,CAGH,Sasha,I must call off the experiments until we know more.,
CAGH035RA,CAGH,Raz,"Sasha, there's no time. I think my vision about Dogen came true. I'm worried it's going to happen to the others if we don't get to the bottom of this quick.",
CAGH036SA,CAGH,Sasha,But we don't know where the foreign projections are coming from yet.,
CAGH037RA,CAGH,Raz,Is there a faster way to find out than sending me in there to investigate?,
CAGI000RA,CAGI,Raz,Wow. Is this what the inside of my mind looks like?,
CAGI001SA,CAGI,Sasha,Not yet. You are still traveling through the astral plane.,
CAGI002SA,CAGI,Sasha,This is a tiny corner of what we call the Collective Unconscious--a place in which all of our unconscious minds are connected.,
CAGI003SA,CAGI,Sasha,"You have just begun your training, Razputin, so many of the connections with other minds are still not developed for you, and those doorways remain just out of reach.",
CAGI004SA,CAGI,Sasha,"But the more you explore the mental world, the more connections you will form.",
CAGI005SA,CAGI,Sasha,Right now the only unconscious world you can enter is that one.,
CAGI006SA,CAGI,Sasha,Your own.,
CAGI007SA,CAGI,Sasha,Step through it and we'll continue.,
CAGJ000CO,CAGJ,Coach,Oof!,
CAGJ001RA,CAGJ,Raz,Hi. I'm here for Basic Braining?,
CAGK000RA,CAGK,Raz,They seem to all be in a trance while they astrally project themselves into the Coach's psyche.,
CAGK001RA,CAGK,Raz,Which is awesome.,

CAGL001DO,CAGL,Dogen,I am not!,

CAGL005DO,CAGL,Dogen,Ooooh! I'm so cool. I'm a squirrel.,
CAGL006DO,CAGL,Dogen,Well you know what we call you? Rats with wings.,
CAGL007DO,CAGL,Dogen,"Well, then we call you something else. Nut rats!",
CAGL008DO,CAGL,Dogen,Fluffy rats!,
CAGL009DO,CAGL,Dogen,And what's that supposed to mean?,
CAGL010DO,CAGL,Dogen,"It's a special hat, and you should be glad I'm wearing it!",
CAGL011DO,CAGL,Dogen,No!,
CAGL012DO,CAGL,Dogen,Never!,
CAGL013DO,CAGL,Dogen,"I do too understand what you're saying, and I don't appreciate it!",
CAGL014DO,CAGL,Dogen,You guys are making me so mad!,
CAGL015DO,CAGL,Dogen,Quit it! You'll knock off my special hat!,
CAGM000RA,CAGM,Raz,"Hey, sorry about hitting you a minute ago. That was totally an accident.",
CAGM001DO,CAGM,Dogen,"Oh, okay, Raz. I know you wouldn't do that on purpose.",
CAGM002RA,CAGM,Raz,"What are they lying to you about, anyway?",
CAGM003DO,CAGM,Dogen,Nothing!,
CAGM004RA,CAGM,Raz,"Hey, what happened to the squirrels?",
CAGM005DO,CAGM,Dogen,They lied. They lied... and then--then--then they--they left.,
CAGN000PH,CAGN,Phoebe,You're lucky I'm not burning people any more.,
CAGN001QU,CAGN,Quentin,"Not cool, bro.",

CAHZ000RA,CAHZ,Raz,"Hey, you guys aren't going around taking people's brains out, are you?",

CAIE000RA,CAIE,Raz,Yes! I got a brain!,
CAIF000FO,CAIF,Ford,"Well, the good thing about you finding that kid's brain--besides the whole thinking and feeling they'll be able to do now--",

CAJQ006CP,CAJQ,Chops,I don't want to get a bad seat.,
CAJQ007JT,CAJQ,J.T.,"Well, you know what they say about slow-rollin' tumbleweeds--",
CAJQ008EL,CAJQ,Elka,No time for chit-chat James. We're late for class!,
CAJR000EF,CAJR,Elton,You have a water phobia? Me too!,
CAJR001RA,CAJR,Raz,"Uh... no. Well, yes. I just... my family has this problem with water.",
CAJR002RA,CAJR,Raz,"It's a bunch of hooey anyway. Some old gypsy curse about how we're all supposed to die in water, if you can believe that.",
CAJR003EF,CAJR,Elton,"Oh, I thought it was about the whole thing with the brain-eating fish that walks out of the lake at night to hunt for victims.",
CAJR004EF,CAJR,Elton,"Well, see ya!",
CAJR005EF,CAJR,Elton,"Um, hey, Raz... I saw you and Lili talking in the Coach's class, and I was wondering",
CAJR006EF,CAJR,Elton,"Were you asking her to... ""go"" with you?",
CAJR007RA,CAJR,Raz,WHAT? No! I'm here to train. No distractions.,
CAJR008EF,CAJR,Elton,Excellent! Bye!,
CAJS000RA,CAJS,Raz,Coach Oleander? I'm reporting for Basic Braining.,
CAJS001CO,CAJS,Coach,"Son, do you realize that to take my course I will have to pull you into my mind...",
CAJS002CO,CAJS,Coach,And you will have to relive every bullet-scarred memory of every battle I have ever faced?,
CAJS003CO,CAJS,Coach,It won't be pretty.,
CAJS004CO,CAJS,Coach,Are you sure you wouldn't rather run around a bit more in the sunshine first?,
CAJS005RA,CAJS,Raz,"I'm ready, sir.",
CAJS006CO,CAJS,Coach,Well then...,
CAJS007RA,CAJS,Raz,"Well, maybe I will explore a bit more before, just so I'm prepared for class.",
CAJS008CO,CAJS,Coach,"No, hurry. No hurry. Enjoy your childhood before it's ripped away from you, son.",
CAJT000RA,CAJT,Raz,Rrrr!,
CAJT001RA,CAJT,Raz,"Man, it's wedged into that little geyser!",
CAJT002RA,CAJT,Raz,Nope. Still won't budge.,
CAZG000TO,CAZG,System,"Raz is holding an object in his hand. To use a handheld object with someone, walk up to them and press /YButton/.",
CAZF002TO,CAZF,System,Press /YButton/ to show button to Oleander.,
CAZG001TO,CAZG,System,Raz has stowed the item in his backpack. Press /DPadLeft/ to see what's in Raz's backpack. Press /DPadRight/ to see what psychic Merit Badges he has.,
CAZF003TO,CAZF,System,Press /YButton/ to talk.,
CAJY000FO,CAJY,Ford,"Sorry, can't get by without a Basic Braining Merit Badge.",
CAJY001RA,CAJY,Raz,Got one!,
CAJY002FO,CAJY,Ford,"Oh... Well... How about a SCAVENGER HUNT LIST, eh smart guy?",
CAJY003RA,CAJY,Raz,Oh man. Where am I going to get one of those?,
CAJY004FO,CAJY,Ford,Right here!,
CAJY005FO,CAJY,Ford,Can't do the Scavenger Hunt without a list.,
CAJY007RA,CAJY,Raz,So where do I-- ,
CAJY008RA,CAJY,Raz,"Hey, where'd he go?",
CAJY009RA,CAJY,Raz,How does that old guy get around so fast?,
CAZG002TO,CAZG,System,"Hey, you've finished half of the Scavenger Hunt, so you've qualified for the first half of your prize! Go see Ranger Ford for your big promotion!",
CAJY011RA,CAJY,Raz,"Hey, check it out. I'm halfway done with the Scavenger Hunt.",
CAJY012FO,CAJY,Ford,Holy smokes. Look at that. ,
CAJY013FO,CAJY,Ford,"Well, then, here's the first half of your reward!",
CAJY014FO,CAJY,Ford,Now don't be lazy! Finish that list! Git!,
CAJY016RA,CAJY,Raz,"Scavenger Hunt, complete. I am awesome.",
CAJY017FO,CAJY,Ford,Great Odin's Rake!,
CAJY018FO,CAJY,Ford,I don't think anyone's ever done the whole thing before!,
CAJY019FO,CAJY,Ford,"Well, hold still. This might hurt.",
CAJY020RA,CAJY,Raz,That felt good.,
CAJY021FO,CAJY,Ford,Congratulations. Now git.,
CAJZ000FO,CAJZ,Ford,Hm. You finally made it.,
CAJZ001RA,CAJZ,Raz,"It's an honor to finally meet you in person, sir.",
CAJZ002RA,CAJZ,Raz,"I thought I recognized you in my dream, but I couldn't be sure. Now that I see you in your element, there's no doubt.",
CAJZ003RA,CAJZ,Raz,You're Ford Cruller.,
CAJZ004RA,CAJZ,Raz,The greatest leader the Psychonauts ever had.,
CAJZ005FO,CAJZ,Ford,"Well, you shouldn't believe everything you read in ""True Psychic Tales"" magazine.",
CAKA000FO,CAKA,Ford,"What are you doing here? You said that girl was waiting for you down by the water! That's Lungfish territory, boy! Go and get her!",
CAKB000FO,CAKB,Ford,"Razputin, come up here. There's something you should see.",
CAKC000FO,CAKC,Ford,"You're the only one left, son.",
CAKC001FO,CAKC,Ford,Can't even make a connection with Sasha or Milla right now for some reason...,
CAKC002RA,CAKC,Raz,Sasha said he had some official Psychonauts business...,
CAKC003FO,CAKC,Ford,"Impossible. I would know it if they did. Nope, something's happened to them.",
CAKC004FO,CAKC,Ford,"Razputin, listen. You're the only one who can stop Oleander now.",
CAKC005RA,CAKC,Raz,What about you? ,
CAKC006FO,CAKC,Ford,"I... I can't leave this cave, Razputin. ",
CAKC007FO,CAKC,Ford,Not as the Ford Cruller you know.,
CAKC008RA,CAKC,Raz,What? Why?,
CAKC009FO,CAKC,Ford,Years ago I was in a terrible psychic duel that left me barely alive.,
CAKC010RA,CAKC,Raz,"Yeah, I read about that. They said your psyche was shattered, that you lost your mind, but... you seem fine to me.",
CAKC011FO,CAKC,Ford,"Yes, when I'm down here, near the Psitanium mother lode. The concentrated power of the Psitanium pulls my thoughts together, keeps me... like my old self.",
CAKC012FO,CAKC,Ford,"But if I leave this sanctuary my psyche becomes disjointed, and I fall into one of my other personalities, with no memory of who I really am.",
CAKC013FO,CAKC,Ford,"I'd be no use to you, unless you needed something raked... or mopped... ",
CAKC014RA,CAKC,Raz,"Well, you can call headquarters and get help!",
CAKC015FO,CAKC,Ford,The Psychonauts won't listen to me. They wrote me off as a loon years ago. That's why Sasha and Milla have to take on all my missions. Headquarters doesn't know I'm the one behind the assignments or they'd never get approved.,
CAKC016FO,CAKC,Ford,But Sasha and Milla seem to be out of commission now.,
CAKC017FO,CAKC,Ford,"YOU have to be my field agent, Razputin. ",
CAKC018FO,CAKC,Ford,Are you ready?,
CAKC019RA,CAKC,Raz,Yes!,
CAKC020RA,CAKC,Raz,No. Not yet.,
CAKC021FO,CAKC,Ford,How about now?,
CAKC022FO,CAKC,Ford,Good. ,
CAKC023FO,CAKC,Ford,"You have to find where that monster took the girl, and if you locate any of the other children's brains along the way, bring them back to me for recranialization, understand?",
CAKC024RA,CAKC,Raz,"Ew. I mean, yes sir!",
CAKD000RA,CAKD,Raz,Agent Cruller?,
CAKD001FO,CAKD,Ford,"So, how goes the training?",
CAKD002FO,CAKD,Ford,What is the current situation?,
CAKE000RA,CAKE,Raz,I'm ready to go back into the field.,
CAKE001FO,CAKE,Ford,"Hey, you wandered off, so I lost the coordinates. What do you think? I got a photographic memory?",
CAKE002FO,CAKE,Ford,"Okay, let's see if I remember exactly where you were...",
CAKE003RA,CAKE,Raz,What are you doing here at Whispering Rock?,
CAKE004FO,CAKE,Ford,This training facility is built right smack on top of the largest Psitanium deposit known to man. ,
CAKE005FO,CAKE,Ford,"It runs under this whole valley and makes this a very critical area for the Psychonauts, so I'm here to look after it.",
CAKE006FO,CAKE,Ford,And to make sure you little spoonbenders don't kill each other.,
CAKE007RA,CAKE,Raz,What's Psitanium?,
CAKE008FO,CAKE,Ford,"Psitanium is a very rare, psychoreactive mineral that crashed here on a meteorite hundreds of years ago.",
CAKE009FO,CAKE,Ford,"It responds to psychic waves. Focuses them, amplifies them.",
CAKE010FO,CAKE,Ford,"It can make psychics more psychic, but it can also make unstable people more unstable. Not everyone can handle that much activity in that part of their brain. It can drive them completely out of their gourd.",
CAKE011FO,CAKE,Ford,Gives this valley an interesting history.,
CAKE012RA,CAKE,Raz,Sasha says I need to learn how to fight better.,
CAKE013FO,CAKE,Ford,He wants to teach you advanced combat? On your first day?,
CAKE014RA,CAKE,Raz,Yeah. I had a vision with a huge monster with yellow eyes and a big mouth full of gnashing teeth...,
CAKE015FO,CAKE,Ford,Did it happen to... spit anything at you?,
CAKE016RA,CAKE,Raz,Yeah. I think it was like an old diving helmet or something.,
CAKE017FO,CAKE,Ford,"I see. Hmm. Yes, well, we'd better get you armed.",
CAKE018RA,CAKE,Raz,Why? What's happening?,
CAKE019FO,CAKE,Ford,"Nothing, nothing. ""Prepare Your Mind."" That's the motto of the Psychonauts.  Here.",
CAKE020FO,CAKE,Ford,This is a Marksmanship Learner's Permit. It will only work when you're in Sasha's mind.,
CAKE021FO,CAKE,Ford,"Once you complete his shooting range, you'll get the real merit badge and you can PSI Blast anywhere you want.",
CAKE022RA,CAKE,Raz,Thanks. PSI Blast?,
CAKE023FO,CAKE,Ford,"Ah, you'll find out. Now get going. We can't have the camp overrun with big-eyed, garbage-spitting monsters, can we?",
CAKE024RA,CAKE,Raz,No sir!,
CAKE025RA,CAKE,Raz,I saw you raking leaves. Was that a disguise?,
CAKE026RA,CAKE,Raz,...and flipping burgers...,
CAKE027RA,CAKE,Raz,...and polishing a canoe...,
CAKE028RA,CAKE,Raz,...and sweeping a porch...,
CAKE029FO,CAKE,Ford,"Er, yes. Well, well, I have many disguises. It helps me keep an eye on you kids wherever you go. Heh heh.",
CAKE030FO,CAKE,Ford,"Now, when I'm in disguise, I may pretend not to recognize you. Don't blow my cover, okay?",
CAKE031RA,CAKE,Raz,Say no more. Your secret identity is safe with me.,
CAKE032RA,CAKE,Raz,So what mission are you on down here?,
CAKE033FO,CAKE,Ford,"Well, from here I can monitor world events, look for signs of psychic terrorism, ripples in the astral plane...",
CAKE034RA,CAKE,Raz,"And then fly out and save the day, right? You've got a jet hidden here somewhere, I'll bet.",
CAKE035FO,CAKE,Ford,Well these days I'm really just more of a dispatcher. I spot the trouble and send out a... younger agent. Like Milla or Sasha... or maybe you some day.,
CAKE036RA,CAKE,Raz,What does all this equipment do?,
CAKE037FO,CAKE,Ford,"Well, up here it's all intel. ",
CAKE038FO,CAKE,Ford,Down that hallway is the observation room. No tests going on in there right now. Maybe later.,
CAKE039FO,CAKE,Ford,And beneath us I have special machines for rebuilding PSI Challenge Markers and detangling Mental Cobwebs. ,
CAKE040FO,CAKE,Ford,"And beneath us I have special machines for rebuilding PSI Challenge Markers, detangling Mental Cobwebs, and crystallizing DEPLETED PSITANIUM.",
CAKE041FO,CAKE,Ford,You should go familiarize yourself with those. They'll come in pretty handy for you.,
CAKE042RA,CAKE,Raz,I'd better go. Lots of work to do.,
CAKE043FO,CAKE,Ford,"Good luck, Razputin!",
CAKF000RA,CAKF,Raz,Thanks. I'll need it!,
CAKF001FO,CAKF,Ford,Don't worry. I'll be right here with you. Inside your head!,
CAKF002RA,CAKF,Raz,My head?,
CAKF003FO,CAKF,Ford,"Yep. I want to keep my eye on you, son. So I'm going to be a psychic stowaway inside your noggin!",
CAKF004FO,CAKF,Ford,"If you ever want to make me appear, you can do it with this special device.",
CAKF005RA,CAKF,Raz,Is that... a piece of bacon?,
CAKF006FO,CAKF,Ford,Ohh yeah. I just love bacon. I smell that stuff and I can't help it! I drop everything and I come running!,
CAKF007RA,CAKF,Raz,"Okay, do you have, like, a little baggie or something I could put this in?",
CAKF008FO,CAKF,Ford,You get a move on or I'll eat that right here!,
CAKG000FO,CAKG,Ford,"Hey, that white room--",
CAKG001RA,CAKG,Raz,I know! It's from Oleander's mind!,
CAKG002RA,CAKG,Raz,"I think I was in the Coach's dream that whole time! Ever since I stepped through the static in the caravan, it felt funny. I knew I wasn't obsessed with meat!",
CAKG003FO,CAKG,Ford,"But Morry is. AND with stealing psychic brains to arm a fleet of deadly tanks, apparently!",
CAKG004RA,CAKG,Raz,I've got to tell Lili. She's waiting for me down by the boathouse.,
CAKG005FO,CAKG,Ford,Down by the... water? Uh oh. Better hurry!,
CAKH000FO,CAKH,Ford,Let's get 'em!,
CAKH001RA,CAKH,Raz,I... can't. I can't swim.,
CAKH002FO,CAKH,Ford,"Well then use the bathysphere at the end of the dock! Quick, while the flipper prints are still glowin'!",
CAKH003RA,CAKH,Raz,Are you coming? I don't know how to drive that thing.,
CAKH004FO,CAKH,Ford,"Uh... I can't. I have to uh.. check on the other children! Yes, yes! If their brains are out they'll need supervision. And possibly refrigeration",
CAKH005FO,CAKH,Ford,And how can you not know how to operate a bathysphere? Haven't you ever been to summer camp before?,
CAKH006FO,CAKH,Ford,"Now get a move on, before that girl gets overly digested.",
CAKI000FO,CAKI,Ford,"Now before you go electrocuting yourself, let me tell you how these babies work.",
CAKI001FO,CAKI,Ford,Now this beauty here is a Mental Cobweb Detangler.,
CAKI002RA,CAKI,Raz,"Ooh, I know what those are. Mental cobwebs are--",
CAKI003FO,CAKI,Ford,"You see, when an area of your psyche is neglected for too long, mental cobwebs form. ",
CAKI004FO,CAKI,Ford,"Now up in the camp store, they sell a very special device known as a Mental Cobweb Duster.",
CAKI005FO,CAKI,Ford,You can take a projection of it into the mental world with you and use it to extract any cobwebs you find.  ,
CAKI006FO,CAKI,Ford,"The duster stores the cobweb's psychic energy on the real world side, so you can take what you collect back here...",
CAKI007FO,CAKI,Ford,"...hook it up to the loom, and weave that tangled mess into something useful!",
CAKI008FO,CAKI,Ford,Like a card from a PSI Challenge Marker!,
CAKI009FO,CAKI,Ford,Which brings us to this fella over here.,
CAKI010FO,CAKI,Ford,"You put NINE PSI CARDS into this guy, along with one PSI CORE--",
CAKI011FO,CAKI,Ford,(Also sold in the company store for a nominal fee.),
CAKI012FO,CAKI,Ford,"And it will kick out a bona fide PSI Challenge Marker, which will earn you a promotion to a higher rank.",
CAKI013FO,CAKI,Ford,"Rank up enough, you'll earn new Psychic abilities!",
CAKI014FO,CAKI,Ford,You got it?,
CAKI015RA,CAKI,Raz,Put my mental cobwebs in there...,
CAKI016RA,CAKI,Raz,...and my PSI Cards and Cores in there.,
CAKI017RA,CAKI,Raz,And soon I'll be able to burn stuff.,
CAKI018FO,CAKI,Ford,"Yep, basically. Have fun!",
CAKJ000FO,CAKJ,Ford,"Son, I will teleport you deep into that solid rock over there, you don't knock that off.",
CAKJ001FO,CAKJ,Ford,Now why did I give him that dang learner's permit?,
CAKJ002FO,CAKJ,Ford,I didn't train you in that so you could set me on fire. Now knock it off!,
CAKJ003FO,CAKJ,Ford,Very nice. Now set me down easy and go pick up something that won't blow up your head if you make it mad.,
CAKJ004FO,CAKJ,Ford,"Hey, not bad! If you didn't eat so much garlic I wouldn't even know you were here!",
CAKJ005FO,CAKJ,Ford,"Ahh, what? No, I--I have to flip... the burgers. No, m--mop the--the... the rake. Uh--ahh! My canoes!",
CAKJ006FO,CAKJ,Ford,Oh no. The attacks are starting even in here! Have to get a bigger Psitanium boulder under the glass...,
CAKJ007RA,CAKJ,Raz,"Hey, Sasha gave me this button and told me to come see him for special training.",
CAKJ008FO,CAKJ,Ford,In what? Sewing? Hahaha!,
CAKJ009FO,CAKJ,Ford,"Well I'm glad to see you made some new friends, after all your old ones got their brains sucked out.",
CAKK000RA,CAKK,Raz,Ford said that I can use this machine to turn pine needles into delicious taffy.,
CAKK001FO,CAKK,Ford,I said it turns Mental Cobwebs into PSI Cards!,
CAKK002RA,CAKK,Raz,Just testing your hearing!,
CAKK003FO,CAKK,Ford,But you gotta buy a cobweb duster at the camp store first!,
CAKK004RA,CAKK,Raz,"Yeah, yeah.",
CAKK005FO,CAKK,Ford,"Ah, don't you ""yeah, yeah"" me!",
CAKK006RA,CAKK,Raz,"Man, he's like a little bat.",
CAKK007FO,CAKK,Ford,"Bat your head in, punk.",
CAKK008RA,CAKK,Raz,Before I use this machine I have to go to the camp store and buy some delicious taffy.,
CAKK009FO,CAKK,Ford,A Mental Cobweb Duster!,
CAKK010RA,CAKK,Raz,A Mental Cobweb Duster.,
CAKK011RA,CAKK,Raz,My Cobweb Duster is empty. I need to go extract more cobwebs from people's minds.,
CAKK012FO,CAKK,Ford,That machine is for collecting mental cobwebs ONLY. ,
CAKK013FO,CAKK,Ford,No monkey business!,
CAKK014FO,CAKK,Ford,You break that equipment and I'll WEAVE YOU into something useful. Like a rug!,
CAKL000RA,CAKL,Raz,I still need to buy a PSI Core at the camp store before I can use this machine to make PSI challenge markers.,
CAKL001RA,CAKL,Raz,I don't have enough PSI Cards to make a new PSI Challenge Marker.,
CAKL002FO,CAKL,Ford,"Hey, you only put PSI Cards, and PSI Cores in there, nothing else, understand? ",
CAKL003RA,CAKL,Raz,Sorry!,
SLAM000RA,SLAM,Raz,I want to shoot more things.,
CAKM000FO,CAKM,Ford,"In recognition of your hard work, dedication, and mental agility, I'm proud to bestow upon you the official merit badge for",
CAKM001FO,CAKM,Ford,Pyrokinesis!,
CAKM002RA,CAKM,Raz,"Cool! I can't wait to burn--hey, what are we doing here?",
CAKM003FO,CAKM,Ford,"Inside your mind. Well, I thought you'd like to be in a familiar place for your first Pyrokinesis lesson.",
CAKM004RA,CAKM,Raz,Lesson?,
CAKM005FO,CAKM,Ford,"Shh. Now, now think of something you'd like to burn.",
CAKM006FO,CAKM,Ford,"Ah, yes, I heard you were raised in the circus. But why would you want to burn all these happy memories here?",
CAKM007RA,CAKM,Raz,"If they were happy memories, I wouldn't have run away.",
CAKM008RA,CAKM,Raz,"My Dad, he hates psychics, and he knew I was becoming one.",
CAKM009RA,CAKM,Raz,"So all day long he would force me to practice my acrobatics, hoping to distract me.",
CAKM010RA,CAKM,Raz,Or maybe hoping to kill me. I never was sure.,
CAKM011FO,CAKM,Ford,Now why are you still talking when you could be burning stuff?,
CAZE007TO,CAZE,System,Hold down /RightFlipper/ to set fire to the targeted object.,
CAKN001FO,CAKN,Ford,Come on now. Just look at something and then use your new power to set it on fire.,
CAKN002FO,CAKN,Ford,You can do it.,
CAKN003FO,CAKN,Ford,Focus. ,
CAKN004FO,CAKN,Ford,Think heat.,
CAKN005FO,CAKN,Ford,"Burn them, Razputin.",
CAKN006FO,CAKN,Ford,Burn them all!,
CAKN007FO,CAKN,Ford,Great! Great!  Now burn the rest!,
CAKN008FO,CAKN,Ford,You're getting warmer! Keep going!,
CAKN009FO,CAKN,Ford,Wooo! It's getting hot in here!,
CAKN010FO,CAKN,Ford,Ooooh this last one's fast! How you gonna get it?,
CAKN011FO,CAKN,Ford,"Come on! You can still burn it, even if it's moving!",
CAZE008TO,CAZE,System,Hold /LeftFlipper/ to lock your mental focus on an object.,
CAKN013FO,CAKN,Ford,"Razputin, lock your mental focus on this last one, and hold it while you use your Pyrokinesis power!",
CAKO000FO,CAKO,Ford,Excellent work!,
CAKO001FO,CAKO,Ford,"Notice how some items are destroyed by fire, but others will burn indefinitely. ",
CAKO002RA,CAKO,Raz,Fire is pretty.,
CAKO003FO,CAKO,Ford,"Okay, that's the end of the lesson. You're free to go, BUT you have to promise me--",
CAKO004FO,CAKO,Ford,"Only use your power of Pyrokinesis only when it's very, very important, or it's really, really entertaining.",
CAKO005RA,CAKO,Raz,I promise.,
CAKO006FO,CAKO,Ford,And if you're doing it to impress girls...,
CAKO007FO,CAKO,Ford,Make sure none of them have on a lot of hairspray.,
CAKP001FO,CAKP,Ford,"With Telekinesis we can use our minds to grasp an object, and then throw it!",
CAKP002FO,CAKP,Ford,Go ahead. Try it yourself!,
CAKP003FO,CAKP,Ford,"Now, grab that trash can with your mind, and hold it until I tell you to let go.",
CAZE009TO,CAZE,System,Hold down /RightFlipper/ while facing target.,
CAKQ000FO,CAKQ,Ford,Grab it!,
CAKQ001FO,CAKQ,Ford,Get a good grip on it with your mind.,
CAKQ002FO,CAKQ,Ford,Come on!,
CAKQ003FO,CAKQ,Ford,It's time to take out the trash!,
CAKQ004FO,CAKQ,Ford,Good! Now...,
CAKQ005FO,CAKQ,Ford,"No, now who said to let that go? Not me!",
CAKQ006FO,CAKQ,Ford,"Now, just think about where you want it to go...",
CAZE010TO,CAZE,System,Use LEFT /Joystick/ to aim your toss.,
CAKQ008FO,CAKQ,Ford,"Yes... now when you've chosen your destination, throw it!",
CAZE011TO,CAZE,System,Press /AButton/ to throw.,
CAKQ010FO,CAKQ,Ford,"You, um, sure you want to do that?",
CAKQ011FO,CAKQ,Ford,"""I love working with kids,"" I said.  ""Send me to work at the camp,"" I said.",
CAKQ012FO,CAKQ,Ford,Well at least you threw it.,
CAKQ013FO,CAKQ,Ford,"Yes, you're very good at Telekinesis. Not so good at following directions. Both are important skills, Razputin.",
CAKR000FO,CAKR,Ford,Woo! Good throw!,
CAKR001FO,CAKR,Ford,NOW!,
CAKR002FO,CAKR,Ford,Let's see if you can make it through the hoop.,
CAKR003RA,CAKR,Raz,You sound like my dad!,
CAKR004FO,CAKR,Ford,"Hey, I've been thinking about that. Why'd that guy hate psychics so much?",
CAKR005FO,CAKR,Ford,What did we ever do to him?,
CAKR006RA,CAKR,Raz,"Well, Psychics killed his whole family. Cursed them and all their descendants to die in water.",
CAKR007FO,CAKR,Ford,Whoa.,
CAKR008RA,CAKR,Raz,Yeah. ,
CAKR009FO,CAKR,Ford,Talk about baggage.,
CAKR010RA,CAKR,Raz,"Tell me about it. And the weird thing is, I'm pretty sure he's actually psychic himself.",
CAKR011FO,CAKR,Ford,Ha! Coo-coo!,
CAKR012FO,CAKR,Ford,Well you can work on him when you get home. ,
CAKR013FO,CAKR,Ford,For now--HOOPS!,
CAKS000FO,CAKS,Ford,Now try to throw that baby right through the hoop.,
CAKS001FO,CAKS,Ford,Right down the center.,
CAKS002FO,CAKS,Ford,"Thread the needle, as they say.",
CAKS003FO,CAKS,Ford,Come on. ,
CAKS004FO,CAKS,Ford,"Through the hoop, Razputin.",
CAKS005FO,CAKS,Ford,Don't be shy.,
CAKS006FO,CAKS,Ford,BE the trash can.,
CAKS007FO,CAKS,Ford,"Ooh, be careful now. ",
CAKT000FO,CAKT,Ford,"Oh, great shot. Let's see you do that again!",
CAKT001FO,CAKT,Ford,"Bingo. Okay, last one!",
CAKT002FO,CAKT,Ford,"Now, let me show you something...",
CAKT003FO,CAKT,Ford,Pick that trash can up and aim your toss at the side of the caravan.,
CAKT004FO,CAKT,Ford,Aim it at the side of the caravan.,
CAKT005FO,CAKT,Ford,The side of the caravan.,
CAKT006FO,CAKT,Ford,"The caravan's side, Einstein.",
CAKU000FO,CAKU,Ford,"Ka-blooie! Throwing something against a wall is a little more destructive than tossing it around on the ground, isn't it?",

CAKU002FO,CAKU,Ford,"Say, when an enemy is--oh my god, look behind you!",
CAKU003FO,CAKU,Ford,Now here is a censor from my mind. Try to grab him when he comes near.,
CAKU004FO,CAKU,Ford,Grab him!,
CAKU005FO,CAKU,Ford,"Okay, let's try that again.",
CAKU006FO,CAKU,Ford,"You see? No time to aim, you mind just reacts! It's a combat reflex that could save your life.",
CAKU007FO,CAKU,Ford,"Oh, no. Another one of my censors. ",
CAKU008FO,CAKU,Ford,"Now, how'd that get in here?",
CAKU009FO,CAKU,Ford,Looks like we're in luck. He doesn't see you yet.,
CAKU010FO,CAKU,Ford,Why don't you smash him on the head with that handy trash can?,
CAKU011FO,CAKU,Ford,Come on!,
CAKU012FO,CAKU,Ford,"Use Telekinesis to pick up the trash can, and throw it at that censor!",
CAKU013FO,CAKU,Ford,Bull's-eye!,

CAKW002FO,CAKW,Ford,Don't let him see you.,
CAKW003FO,CAKW,Ford,Don't make a sound.,

CAKY001FO,CAKY,Ford,Ready to come back and get your new merit badge?,
CAKI019FO,CAKI,Ford,This is the Psitanium Crystallizer.,
CAKI020FO,CAKI,Ford,"Now you see, when you are carrying Psitanium, say in the form of arrowheads, it has a transferable presence that you can pass to other entities that you meet in the astral plane.",
CAKI021RA,CAKI,Raz,So...  I can spend my arrowheads when I'm inside someone's mind?,
CAKI022FO,CAKI,Ford,"Ah yes, but transferring your arrowheads' psychic energy to someone else causes a physical breakdown in the host media, and your actual arrowhead will disappear.",
CAKI023RA,CAKI,Raz,So when they're spent they're spent.,
CAKI024FO,CAKI,Ford,"Now right again, but the transfer can work both ways. If you collect deposits of Psitanium energy in the mental world, or DEPLETED PSITANIUM, we can extract that energy from you and crystallize it into physical Psitanium here, with this device.",
CAKI025RA,CAKI,Raz,And print money. Very handy!,
