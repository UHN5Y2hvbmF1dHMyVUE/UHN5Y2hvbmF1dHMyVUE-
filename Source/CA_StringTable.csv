CAAJ016MF,CA_StringTable.csv,Maloof,What's that?,
CAAJ017MH,CA_StringTable.csv,Mikhail,Like Deadly Nelson but less dying.,
CAAJ018MF,CA_StringTable.csv,Maloof,How much less?,
CAAJ019MH,CA_StringTable.csv,Mikhail,Half.,

CAAO002VE,CA_StringTable.csv,Vernon,"Yup, it's true.",
CAAO003VE,CA_StringTable.csv,Vernon,It happened back when this place was still an Indian summer camp and burial ground.,
CAAO004VE,CA_StringTable.csv,Vernon,A group of Union soldiers got separated from their regiment.,
CAAO005VE,CA_StringTable.csv,Vernon,Night was falling and they were cold and scared... Of Dracula! BOO! Huh-hahaha!,
CAAO006VE,CA_StringTable.csv,Vernon,"Uhm, I'm kidding. They were just terrified of getting shot.",
CAAO007VE,CA_StringTable.csv,Vernon,Though I'm sure any of them with any sense were afraid of Dracula too.,
CAAO008VE,CA_StringTable.csv,Vernon,They stumbled across an old building--you can still see it on the far side of the lake.,
CAAO009VE,CA_StringTable.csv,Vernon,So they decided to spend the night there.,
CAAO010VE,CA_StringTable.csv,Vernon,Little did they know it was...,
CAAO011VE,CA_StringTable.csv,Vernon,An abandoned Indian insane asylum built on a caveman burial ground!,
CAAO012VE,CA_StringTable.csv,Vernon,Little did they also know that a cursed fish lived in the asylum.,
CAAO013VE,CA_StringTable.csv,Vernon,And that he was an escaped lunatic.,
CAAO014VE,CA_StringTable.csv,Vernon,But from a different asylum.,
CAAO015VE,CA_StringTable.csv,Vernon,"So even though he was actually living in an asylum, he was still counted as escaped.",
CAAO016VE,CA_StringTable.csv,Vernon,And what was his curse you ask?,
CAAO017VE,CA_StringTable.csv,Vernon,Where his gills should have been...,
CAAO018VE,CA_StringTable.csv,Vernon,He. Had. Hooks!,
CAAO019VE,CA_StringTable.csv,Vernon,"Yup, and where one of the hooks should have been...",
CAAO020VE,CA_StringTable.csv,Vernon,He. Had. A. Lung! Yup... a lung!,
CAAO021VE,CA_StringTable.csv,Vernon,And instead of being about fourteen inches long.,
CAAO022VE,CA_StringTable.csv,Vernon,He. Was. Ten. Feet. Tall.,
CAAO023VE,CA_StringTable.csv,Vernon,But that wasn't the scariest thing.,
CAAO024VE,CA_StringTable.csv,Vernon,The scariest thing...,
CAAO025VE,CA_StringTable.csv,Vernon,The absolute scariest thing...,
CAAO026VE,CA_StringTable.csv,Vernon,And the thing that still makes the old timers' blood turn to ice and vice versa...,
CAAO027VE,CA_StringTable.csv,Vernon,Is the part I said first about how he had hooks for gills.,
CAAO028VE,CA_StringTable.csv,Vernon,Oh Brrrrrr.,

CABB010VE,CA_StringTable.csv,Vernon,It did seem kind of weird when they let me get this close to them.,
CABB011VE,CA_StringTable.csv,Vernon,And then they didn't mind when I talked all through the show.,
CABB012VE,CA_StringTable.csv,Vernon,Kitty even agreed to go on a date with me more or less--we're gonna play hackey sack!,
CABB013RA,CA_StringTable.csv,Raz,Keep an eye on them Vernon.,

CABE003EL,CA_StringTable.csv,Elka,"Yes, he's less filthy. That's part of it.",
CABE004EL,CA_StringTable.csv,Elka,But the biggest change is that he can't possibly waste as much time as he used to hanging out with his loser friends.,
CABE005CP,CA_StringTable.csv,Chops,I don't like you.,
CABE006EL,CA_StringTable.csv,Elka,And I don't like you. So that covers everything we have in common.,

CAGH001RA,CA_StringTable.csv,Raz,Have you tested this thing out on humans yet?,

CAGH031SA,CA_StringTable.csv,Sasha,Hmm.,
CAGH032SA,CA_StringTable.csv,Sasha,I've been running some tests. It seems that the sensitive circuitry of the Brain Tumbler is picking up too much psychic interference to be safe. ,

CAGH036SA,CA_StringTable.csv,Sasha,But we don't know where the foreign projections are coming from yet.,
CAGH037RA,CA_StringTable.csv,Raz,Is there a faster way to find out than sending me in there to investigate?,
CAGI000RA,CA_StringTable.csv,Raz,Wow. Is this what the inside of my mind looks like?,
CAGI001SA,CA_StringTable.csv,Sasha,Not yet. You are still traveling through the astral plane.,
CAGI002SA,CA_StringTable.csv,Sasha,This is a tiny corner of what we call the Collective Unconscious--a place in which all of our unconscious minds are connected.,
CAGI003SA,CA_StringTable.csv,Sasha,"You have just begun your training, Razputin, so many of the connections with other minds are still not developed for you, and those doorways remain just out of reach.",

CAGI005SA,CA_StringTable.csv,Sasha,Right now the only unconscious world you can enter is that one.,

CAKC009FO,CA_StringTable.csv,Ford,Years ago I was in a terrible psychic duel that left me barely alive.,

CAKE006FO,CA_StringTable.csv,Ford,And to make sure you little spoonbenders don't kill each other.,
CAKE007RA,CA_StringTable.csv,Raz,What's Psitanium?,
CAKE008FO,CA_StringTable.csv,Ford,"Psitanium is a very rare, psychoreactive mineral that crashed here on a meteorite hundreds of years ago.",
CAKE009FO,CA_StringTable.csv,Ford,"It responds to psychic waves. Focuses them, amplifies them.",
CAKE010FO,CA_StringTable.csv,Ford,"It can make psychics more psychic, but it can also make unstable people more unstable. Not everyone can handle that much activity in that part of their brain. It can drive them completely out of their gourd.",
CAKE011FO,CA_StringTable.csv,Ford,Gives this valley an interesting history.,

CAKE013FO,CA_StringTable.csv,Ford,He wants to teach you advanced combat? On your first day?,
CAKE014RA,CA_StringTable.csv,Raz,Yeah. I had a vision with a huge monster with yellow eyes and a big mouth full of gnashing teeth...,
CAKE015FO,CA_StringTable.csv,Ford,Did it happen to... spit anything at you?,
CAKE016RA,CA_StringTable.csv,Raz,Yeah. I think it was like an old diving helmet or something.,
CAKE017FO,CA_StringTable.csv,Ford,"I see. Hmm. Yes, well, we'd better get you armed.",
CAKE018RA,CA_StringTable.csv,Raz,Why? What's happening?,
CAKE019FO,CA_StringTable.csv,Ford,"Nothing, nothing. ""Prepare Your Mind."" That's the motto of the Psychonauts.  Here.",
CAKE020FO,CA_StringTable.csv,Ford,This is a Marksmanship Learner's Permit. It will only work when you're in Sasha's mind.,

CAKE022RA,CA_StringTable.csv,Raz,Thanks. PSI Blast?,
CAKE023FO,CA_StringTable.csv,Ford,"Ah, you'll find out. Now get going. We can't have the camp overrun with big-eyed, garbage-spitting monsters, can we?",
CAKE024RA,CA_StringTable.csv,Raz,No sir!,
CAKE025RA,CA_StringTable.csv,Raz,I saw you raking leaves. Was that a disguise?,
CAKE026RA,CA_StringTable.csv,Raz,...and flipping burgers...,

CAKE031RA,CA_StringTable.csv,Raz,Say no more. Your secret identity is safe with me.,
CAKE032RA,CA_StringTable.csv,Raz,So what mission are you on down here?,
CAKE033FO,CA_StringTable.csv,Ford,"Well, from here I can monitor world events, look for signs of psychic terrorism, ripples in the astral plane...",
CAKE034RA,CA_StringTable.csv,Raz,"And then fly out and save the day, right? You've got a jet hidden here somewhere, I'll bet.",
CAKE035FO,CA_StringTable.csv,Ford,Well these days I'm really just more of a dispatcher. I spot the trouble and send out a... younger agent. Like Milla or Sasha... or maybe you some day.,
CAKE036RA,CA_StringTable.csv,Raz,What does all this equipment do?,
CAKE037FO,CA_StringTable.csv,Ford,"Well, up here it's all intel. ",
CAKE038FO,CA_StringTable.csv,Ford,Down that hallway is the observation room. No tests going on in there right now. Maybe later.,

CAKK002RA,CA_StringTable.csv,Raz,Just testing your hearing!,
