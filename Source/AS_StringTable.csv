ASAN003SH,ASAN,Sheegor,Maybe they're right. Maybe you are mean and they should put your brain in one of those tanks.,
ASAN004SH,ASAN,Sheegor,Or else Mr. Pokeylope here will bite you on the pinky toe. Isn't that right Mr. P? ,
ASAN005SH,ASAN,Sheegor,Don't even try it.,
ASAN006SH,ASAN,Sheegor,Ooohhhhh ohhhhhohhhh... ,

ASUR003RA,ASUR,Raz,The things I do for Lili's brain.,
ASUR004RA,ASUR,Raz,"Well, if I'm going to get to the top of this thing, I'd better start hiking.",
ASPR000SA,ASPR,Sasha,But Razputin. Recranialization of an adult brain without surgery...,
ASPR001MI,ASPR,Milla,That's a very advanced procedure. How did you know how to do it?,
ASPR002RA,ASPR,Raz,"Well, I've studied it a little",
ASPR003RA,ASPR,Raz,But Sheegor here knows more about handling brains than anyone I've ever met.,
ASPR004SA,ASPR,Sasha,Really? You know I've been thinking about getting a lab assistant...,
ASPR005MI,ASPR,Milla,"Sheegor, darling, do you know where all of the other children's brains are?",
ASPR006SA,ASPR,Sasha,"Well, if you can lead us to them--",
ASPR007SA,ASPR,Sasha,We can bring them back to their owners... immediately...,
ASPR008LI,ASPR,Lili,A-hem!,
ASPR009SA,ASPR,Sasha,Immediately after we break young Ms. Zanotto here out of her restraints.,
ASAP002LI,ASAP,Lili,Careful!,
ASAP003LI,ASAP,Lili,Maybe try it at the same time!,
ASAP004LI,ASAP,Lili,Raz! Come on! We need your help!,
ASAP005LI,ASAP,Lili,Oof!,
ASAP006LI,ASAP,Lili,It's getting hot.,

ASAP014SA,ASAP,Sasha,Are you sure you're using prime oscillations?,
ASAP015SA,ASAP,Sasha,Maybe it's been psychically sealed?,
ASAP016SA,ASAP,Sasha,"Razputin, we could use a hand.",
ASAP017MI,ASAP,Milla,NNg.,
ASAP018MI,ASAP,Milla,Ha!,

ASAP026MI,ASAP,Milla,"Hang on, Lili.",
ASAP027MI,ASAP,Milla,"Raz, darling. Why aren't you helping?",
ASAQ000RA,ASAQ,Raz,Hm. This elevator is locked up tight.,
ASAQ001RA,ASAQ,Raz,Nope. Doesn't look like it's going to budge.,
ASAQ002RA,ASAQ,Raz,That's the express elevator up to Doctor Loboto's lab.,
ASAQ003RA,ASAQ,Raz,Hm. Judging from its position...,
ASAQ004RA,ASAQ,Raz,I can take this elevator all they way down to the asylum grounds.,
ASAQ005RA,ASAQ,Raz,I'm pretty high up. I hope this ride isn't too--,
ASAQ006RA,ASAQ,Raz,Scary!,
ASAQ007RA,ASAQ,Raz,Well at least it's fast.,
ASAR000RA,ASAR,Raz,Excellent. There it is.,
ASAR001RA,ASAR,Raz,"Good work, Sheegor. ",
ASAR002RA,ASAR,Raz,Now all we have to do is get it in the Brain Tank somehow.,

ASAS001FR,ASAS,Fred,"Hey, I'm always ready to give up. Anything!",
ASAS002FR,ASAS,Fred,Oh no! I think I hear the enemy's bugles! They're rallying another attack!,

ASAS005NP,ASAS,Napoleon,Put me down this instant or I will have you drawn and quartered!,
ASAS006FR,ASAS,Fred,"That's okay, I'm used to getting beat.",
ASAS007NP,ASAS,Napoleon,Ha! Come on. Even Wellington hit harder than that!,
ASAS008FR,ASAS,Fred,Whoa wait a second...,
ASAS009FR,ASAS,Fred,I like war! War is fun! Victory is important to me.,
ASAS010NP,ASAS,Napoleon,No it is not! It is terrible. It is like eating British food every day.,

ASAT007FR,ASAT,Fred,I remembered that it was kind of fun!,
ASAT008FR,ASAT,Fred,Just running a couple strategy ideas through my head...,

ASAT016FR,ASAT,Fred,That was strange.,
ASAU000RA,ASAU,Raz,"Wow, a teddy bear. Those crazy kids...",
ASAU001FR,ASAU,Fred,That's not a teddy bear! That's my Hearty Knight! He's going to storm the castle!,
ASAU002NP,ASAU,Napoleon,I will believe that when I see it!,
ASAU003RA,ASAU,Raz,These little lawn gnome guys sure get around.,
ASAU004FR,ASAU,Fred,That's my Carpenter. He fixes bridges!,
ASAU005NP,ASAU,Napoleon,Which I love to break! Ha ha!,
ASAU006RA,ASAU,Raz,Looks like a rusty old wheel off one of those rusty old gurneys.,
ASAU007FR,ASAU,Fred,Don't make fun of my Militia men! Those guys are hard to recruit!,
ASAU008NP,ASAU,Napoleon,"Not if they were inspired by their leader, or paid well, or well armed, or even fed!",
ASAU009FR,ASAU,Fred,I'm trying!,
ASAU010FR,ASAU,Fred,"Don't bother. They fireproofed this whole building. A lot of the old inmates used to be firestarters, you know.",
ASAU011FR,ASAU,Fred,Oh great! You ruined everything. Now I lost.,
ASAU012NP,ASAU,Napoleon,You were losing anyway.,
ASAU013FR,ASAU,Fred,"Oh just shut up and let me pout alone, will you.",
ASAU014NP,ASAU,Napoleon,I want to play again!,
ASAU015FR,ASAU,Fred,"Interesting. Well, that's a possible strategy I guess.",
ASAW000ED,ASAW,Edgar,Must you practice that instrument in here Razputin?,
ASAW001ED,ASAW,Edgar,It is always a pleasure to meet an individual with great taste in boots.,
ASAW002ED,ASAW,Edgar,What's that smell? I hope nothing's burning.,
ASAW003ED,ASAW,Edgar,"With all the flammable chemicals I have in here, that would be a disaster.",
ASAW004ED,ASAW,Edgar,"Ah, you try my patience, Razputin!",
ASAW005ED,ASAW,Edgar,Nobody lifts Edgar Teglee!,
ASAW006ED,ASAW,Edgar,I uh oh... Who chained this building to my leg?,
ASAW007ED,ASAW,Edgar,I... really wish I had some pastels... Or water colors,
ASAX000RA,ASAX,Raz,"Sorry, but did you see a girl--",
ASAX001RA,ASAX,Raz,"So, did you not see a girl come through here?",
ASAX002GL,ASAX,Gloria,"Handsome, I'm not the stage director. I don't track the entrances and exits.",
ASAX003RA,ASAX,Raz,"What are you doing out here, Gloria? ",
ASAX004GL,ASAX,Gloria,"I can't remember the last time I came out here at night. It's so beautiful, isn't it?",
ASAX005GL,ASAX,Gloria,These plants could use a little water though. Now where's that hose?,
ASAX006GL,ASAX,Gloria,"Ooh, sounds like one of the French horns in the orchestra is a little flat.",
ASAX007GL,ASAX,Gloria,"Pleasure to meet you. I'd sign your shell, but I haven't got a pen.",
ASAX008GL,ASAX,Gloria,Oooooh...,

ASAX011GL,ASAX,Gloria,Ooh!,
ASAX012GL,ASAX,Gloria,OoooOooohhh ooohhhooooOOOoo..,
ASAY000BO,ASAY,Boyd,"Ahh, the call of the pelican. The pelican knows the danger of plastics.",
ASAY001RA,ASAY,Raz,"Hey, did you happen to see a girl drop this bracelet?",
ASAY002BO,ASAY,Boyd,How could I see anything? When we've all got our heads in the sand?,
ASAY003BO,ASAY,Boyd,Nothing can distract me from the mission. ,
ASAY004BO,ASAY,Boyd,I will not rest until I've delivered the milk.,
ASAZ000RA,ASAZ,Raz,"Man, something that ugly really should be burned.",
ASBA000SA,ASBA,Sasha,Teeee Veeee.,
ASBA001SA,ASBA,Sasha,"Razputin, instead of that why don't you help me free Ms. Zanotto?",
ASBB001MI,ASBB,Milla,"That's nice, darling, but why don't you help us instead?",
ASBC000RA,ASBC,Raz,"Okay, then we'll talk about that making out thing later.",
ASBC001LI,ASBC,Lili,"Why do boys have no concept of a ""moment?""",
ASBC002LI,ASBC,Lili,THAT was a moment. THIS is not a moment. Sheesh.,
ASBC003RA,ASBC,Raz,"Hey, hey. I totally understand. I swear.",
ASBC004RA,ASBC,Raz,"So is this going to be like... an open mouth kiss, or--",
ASBC005LI,ASBC,Lili,Raz! Go get Sasha and Milla's brains back so you can all bust me out of here!,
ASBC006RA,ASBC,Raz,Right!,
ASZG000TO,ASZG,System,"Excellent find! A fellow cadet's brain! If you take it back to Ford Cruller for recranialization, your total mental health potential will be increased!",
ASZF000TO,ASZF,System,Punch jar to free brain.,
ASBD002RA,ASBD,Raz,"I don't think I can fit that jar in my backpack, but if I busted out the brain... I'll bet they compress nicely.",
ASBD003RA,ASBD,Raz,"Bobby Zilch? I didn't know you had a brain. Heh heh. Man, I wish you were here for that joke, Bobby.",
ASBD004RA,ASBD,Raz,Dogen Boole! I told you I'd get your brain back!,
ASBD005RA,ASBD,Raz,Benny. Huh. I thought it would be smaller.,
ASBD006RA,ASBD,Raz,Elka Doom. Maybe I should let J.T. have some time alone before I return this brain.,
ASBD007RA,ASBD,Raz,"Kitty's brain. You know, I hate to say it, but it IS better groomed than the rest of the brains. ",
ASBD008RA,ASBD,Raz,"How Chloe sneezed this one through that helmet, we'll never know.",
ASBD009RA,ASBD,Raz,"Don't worry, Franke. I'll put this one right next to Kitty's.",
ASBD010RA,ASBD,Raz,J.T.'s brain? How'd this little dogie get out of the pen?,
ASBD011RA,ASBD,Raz,"Yo, Quentin. Good to see your brain again.",
ASBD012RA,ASBD,Raz,How can something as small as Vernon's brain hold so many boring stories?,
ASBD013RA,ASBD,Raz,I'm surprised Milka's brain doesn't go invisible when I get close to it.,
ASBD014RA,ASBD,Raz,Yay! Woo-hoo! Crystal's brain! Let's hear it for thinking!,
ASBD015RA,ASBD,Raz,Clem's brain! Three cheers for brains! ,
ASBD016RA,ASBD,Raz,To think that every cell in Nils' brain is dedicated to the ladies.,
ASBD017RA,ASBD,Raz,Better give Maloof's brain to Mikhail ASAP so he can protect it.,
ASBD018RA,ASBD,Raz,"Welcome back to the thinking world, Mikhail.",
ASBD019RA,ASBD,Raz,Huh. Phoebe's brain is warmer than the others'.,
ASBD020RA,ASBD,Raz,"Elton, what can I tell you? You were right. The old legends were true.",
ASBD021RA,ASBD,Raz,"Chops. What is up, eh?",
ASBE000RA,ASBE,Raz,That poor little turtle. If only I could reach in there and save him! But I can't!,
ASBE001LO,ASBE,Dr.Loboto,"(sniff, sniff)",
ASBE002LO,ASBE,Dr.Loboto,Mmmmm. Do I smell... turtle soup?,
ASBG000RA,ASBG,Raz,"Mr. Pokeylope, if you could move just under that hole there?",
ASBG001RA,ASBG,Raz,Then I could lift you straight out.,
ASBG002RA,ASBG,Raz,Could you do that for me? Huh?,
ASBH000RA,ASBH,Raz,I'd never get it past that psychic shield.,
ASBH001RA,ASBH,Raz,"And anyway, now's not the time for turtle brain diving!",
ASBH002PL,ASBH,Mr.Pokeylope,"Man, that song reminds me of this fine chick I used to date.",
ASBH003PL,ASBH,Mr.Pokeylope,Hmmmmmmm.,
ASBH004PL,ASBH,Mr.Pokeylope,"Hey now, when I get into that Brain Tank, I'll have a choice of who to shoot, understand?",

ASBI002RA,ASBI,Raz,Uh oh...,
ASBI003LO,ASBI,Dr.Loboto,"Hey, what was that? Perhaps I should turn around slowly to see who's there...",
ASBJ000ED,ASBJ,Edgar,"Oh, great. Now what am I supposed to do?",
ASBJ001ED,ASBJ,Edgar,It's not like I can reach a regular restroom when I'm all chained up like this.,
ASBK000RA,ASBK,Raz,"There he is, Doctor Loboto.",
ASBK001RA,ASBK,Raz,"I feel like I know him so well, having practically lived in his skin earlier today.",
ASBK002RA,ASBK,Raz,I'd never get it through that shield. ,
ASBK003RA,ASBK,Raz,"And some minds, I really just don't want to see.",
ASBK004RA,ASBK,Raz,"Alright, so maybe I do, but I still can't get in there.",
ASBM001GL,ASBM,Gloria,I believe I shall happily retire... while I'm still young.,
