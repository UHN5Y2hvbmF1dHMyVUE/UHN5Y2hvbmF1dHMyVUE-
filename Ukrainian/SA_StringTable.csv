"SACO001RA","Raz","Oh, yeah. Come to poppa!",""
"SACO002SA","Sasha","Raz, what have you done? This is not control! This is chaos!",""
"SACO003SA","Sasha","I'll try to fix it. You stay here and keep their numbers under control.",""
"SAFB004SA","Sasha","This is a censor.","Це так званий цензор."
"SAIN001SA","Sasha","Welcome to my mind.","Ласкаво прошу до мого розуму."
"SAIN002RA","Raz","Huh. It's so empty.","Га. Він такий порожній."
"SAIN003RA","Raz","Uh, I mean--","Е-е, тобто..."
"SAIN004SA","Sasha","There's more here than meets the eye, but I've learned to keep it under strict control.","Він такий лише на перший погляд. Я навчився тримати його під суворим контролем."
"SAIN005SA","Sasha","And that's what I'm going to teach you: control.","Саме цьому я і вчитиму тебе: контролю."
"SAIN006SA","Sasha","Your feelings, your fears, your anger. You must learn to control them, focus them, concentrate them, and release them.","Будь то почуття, страхи, лють. Ти мусиш контролювати їх, фокусувати, концентрувати, і вивільняти."
"SAIN007RA","Raz","As therapy?","В якості терапії?"
"SAIN008SA","Sasha","No, as firepower!","Ні, вогневої міці!"
"SAIN009SA","Sasha","Say something hideous and horrible jumps out at you. Something so disgusting that it simply must die.","Уяви ситуацію, на тебе вистрибує щось огидне та мерзенне. Настільки жахливе, що воно просто зобов'язано вмерти."
"SAIN010SA","Sasha","Ahhh, oh, so tacky... I… can't... look... directly at it!","А-а-ах, ох, який несмак... Не... можу... дивитися!"
"SAIN011SA","Sasha","But I control those feelings, focus them, concentrate, and…","Але я контролюю ці почуття, фокусую їх, концентрую, і..."
"SAIN012SA","Sasha","…release!","Вивільняю!"
"SAIN013SA","Sasha","And the world is a better place.","І одразу стало легше жити."
"SAIN014SA","Sasha","Your turn.","Твоя черга."
"SAIN015RA","Raz","Okay...","Гаразд..."
"SAIN016RA","Raz","Hggfgg!  Gahhh!",""
"SAIN017SA","Sasha","Excellent. A victory for good taste.","Блискуче. Перемога на користь почуття смаку."
"SAIN018SA","Sasha","Now, you must strive for precision when targeting. Say you were set upon by multiple attackers.","Далі, ти маєш прагнути точності під час прицілювання. Скажімо, на тебе вибігло декілька ворогів."
"SAIN019SA","Sasha","Eh.","Ех."
"SAIN020SA","Sasha","Yecch.","Фу."
"SAIN021SA","Sasha","Bleh.","Мда."
"SAIN022SA","Sasha","But you need to dispense with them in a certain order. Eliminate these monsters in the proper sequence and we can move on to the next lesson.","Але їх треба ліквідувати в певному порядку. Усунь цих монстрів у належній послідовності, і ми перейдемо до наступного іспиту."
"SAMC001SA","Sasha","Young man, I hope you've learned a lesson here today.",""
"SAMC002RA","Raz","Yes I have.",""
"SAMC003RA","Raz","That shooting things is fun and useful.",""
"SAMC004SA","Sasha","No, that once you lose control of your own mind, it's very hard to get it back!",""
"SAMC005RA","Raz","Yes. One's thoughts must be 100% controlled at all times!",""
"SAMC006SA","Sasha","Well, no. Actually, if you try to completely suppress your undesirable feelings, they'll build and build and eventually explode.",""
"SAMC007RA","Raz","Oh. So, uh, what would happen if you were to, say, completely block off all your censor outlets?",""
"SAMC008SA","Sasha","Well, there would be a buildup of censor energy within, that would... uh… eventually…",""
"SAMC009SA","Sasha","Run, Razputin. Very fast.",""
"SAMC010SA","Sasha","You are my own creation. I command you to stop!",""
"SAMC012SA","Sasha","Ahhhhhhh!",""
"SAMC013SA","Sasha","Razputin, it's time to earn your merit badge!",""
"SASE001SA","Sasha","Again.",""
"SASE002SA","Sasha","Come now. Focus.",""
"SASE003SA","Sasha","Shoot!",""
"SASE004SA","Sasha","Repeat.",""
"SASE005SA","Sasha","What are you waiting for?",""
"SASE006SA","Sasha","Let's get moving.",""
"SASE007SA","Sasha","Excellent.",""
"SASE008SA","Sasha","Control.",""
"SASE009SA","Sasha","Focus.",""
"SASE010SA","Sasha","Concentrate.",""
"SASE011SA","Sasha","Release.",""
"SASE012SA","Sasha","Try it again.",""
"SASS001SA","Sasha","Ahhhhh!",""
"SASS002SA","Sasha","Ach!",""
"SASS003SA","Sasha","Ai-ai-ai-ai-ai!",""
"SASS004SA","Sasha","Razputin!",""
"SASS005SA","Sasha","Oooh-ooh-oooh...",""
"SASS006SA","Sasha","Peel me off and put me down!",""
"SASS007SA","Sasha","Enough!",""
"SASS008SA","Sasha","Oof!","Уф!"
"SASS009SA","Sasha","Uggg!",""
"SASS010SA","Sasha","Ow!",""
"SASS011SA","Sasha","Gahhhh!",""
"SAAB001SA","Sasha","No, Raz, shoot them in order. Let's try this again.",""
"SAAC002RA","Raz","This is controlled by that dial over there.",""
"SAAD003RA","Raz","This is going to take forever. I wonder if I can speed it up somehow.",""
"SAAD004RA","Raz","I wonder what would happen if I turned that dial up.",""
"SACD001RA","Raz","So, is this where I get a speech and learn another lesson?",""
"SACD002SA","Sasha","No. Here's your merit badge. Let us never speak of this again.",""
"SAFB001SA","Sasha","Now then...","Ну що ж..."
"SAFB002SA","Sasha","Is this what you saw in your vision?","Це те чудовисько з твого віщого сну?"
"SAFB005SA","Sasha","An integral part of any sane person's mind.","Невіддільна частина розуму будь-якої притомної людини."
"SAFB006SA","Sasha","The censors roam through your psyche, looking for thoughts that don't belong.","Цензори блукають твоєю свідомістю в пошуку неналежних думок."
"SAFB007SA","Sasha","Hallucinations, manias, waking dreams--the censors hunt them down and censor them out.","Галюцинації, манії, сни наяву — все це цензори відстежують та придушують."
"SAFB008RA","Raz","Why do they come after me? I'm not a mania!","А на мене нащо нападати? Я ж не манія!"
"SAFB009SA","Sasha","Yes, but you are a foreign entity in my mind. You technically don't belong here.","Так, але ти чужа істота в моєму розумі. З технічної точки зору, ти тут не належиш."
"SAFB901SA","Sasha","Yes. Well, the Brain Tumbler could be malfunctioning. Or you could be insane.","Твоя правда. Ну, можливо, мозковий тумблер барахлить. Або ти божевільний."
"SAFB902SA","Sasha","We'll test for that later. For now...","Це ми дізнаємось згодом. А поки що..."
"SAFB010RA","Raz","So, what do I do?",""
"SAFB011SA","Sasha","Blast it!","Стріляй!"
"SAFB012SA","Sasha","That's the spirit.","Оце я розумію характер."
"SAFB013RA","Raz","I killed it.","Ото я його поклав."
"SAFB014SA","Sasha","It was just a thought I was having. And it's not dead. It has just returned to its basic form--raw psychic energy. Go absorb it. It's good for your mental health.",""
"SAFB015SA","Sasha","Now I'll leave the machine on for you, so you can practice. You have to blast 1000 censors to earn your Marksmanship Merit Badge.",""
"SAFB016SA","Sasha","Come back every day for practice, and you should have enough in as little as three weeks!",""
"SAFB017RA","Raz","Three weeks! I only have a few days to earn ALL my merit badges and become a Psychonaut.",""
"SAFB018SA","Sasha","Slow and steady wins the race, my eager young friend. Now practice. Slowly and carefully.",""
"SAFB019RA","Raz","Oh man...",""
"SAFD001RA","Raz","I need to stop whatever's shooting out these censors!",""
"SAFE001RA","Raz","Those little censors are re-energizing the big one somehow.",""
"SAFF001RA","Raz","This should stop any more censors from coming out of here.",""
"SAFG001SA","Sasha","Destroy them all!",""
"SAFH002SA","Sasha","Well done, Raz. Keep shooting!","Чудово, Разпутіне. Продовжуй стріляти!"
"SAFH003SA","Sasha","Good. Again!","Добре. Ще раз!"
"SAFI004SA","Sasha","Razputin! You must blast the emergency shut-down valves!",""
"SAFI005SA","Sasha","It's the only way to close off the leak!",""
"SAFI006SA","Sasha","Shut down all the valves on this face to get it under control!",""
"SAFI007SA","Sasha","Hurry, Razputin!",""
"SAAA000SA","Sasha","Yes, yes. We all know you can punch things.",""
"SAAA001SA","Sasha","But you're supposed to be learning how to use your PSI Blast now.",""
"SAAA002SA","Sasha","Try it without punching.",""
"SAAF000RA","Raz","That's it! I've completely blocked off all of Sasha's censor outlets!  I can't wait to tell him.",""
"SAAG000SA","Sasha","Enough horseplay, Razputin! Destroy him!",""
"SAAG001SA","Sasha","The small censors are feeding into his strength. You must stop them!",""
"SAAG002SA","Sasha","Destroy the valves that are emitting the small censors, Razputin!",""
"SAAG003SA","Sasha","Raz! Shoot the valves! It's no use shooting the monster until you've destroyed every valve!",""
"SAAG004SA","Sasha","Don't forget to use your mental focus to lock on the valves as a target, and then blast them!",""
"SAZE004TO","System","Use {LeftFlipper} to lock mental focus.",""
"SAAG006SA","Sasha","Say, Razputin. Do you think you could reach in my pocket and hand me my cigarettes? ",""
"SAAG007SA","Sasha","Excellent! You've shut down the valves so he cannot be rejuvenated. Now destroy him!",""
"SAAG008SA","Sasha","Use your mental focus Razputin! It will help you shoot accurately, and also help you with your evasive maneuvers!",""
"SAAG009SA","Sasha","When focused, you can tumble to the side, avoid his stamp, and circle around behind the monster!",""
"SAAG010SA","Sasha","Watch out for those tumbling boils he's throwing at you. They're full of censors!",""
"SAAG011SA","Sasha","You can kill many small censors in one blow, if you jump up in the air above them and then smash the ground with your psychic fist.",""
"SAZE005TO","System","Press {XButton} while airborne to execute a Palm Bomb.",""
"SAAG013SA","Sasha","Oh, you. What a pleasant surprise.",""
"SAAG014SA","Sasha","Enough, Razputin! The beast must die, now!",""
"SAAG015SA","Sasha","If you are mentally focused, and executing a sideways tumble, it will be very hard for him to stamp you.",""
"SAAG016SA","Sasha","Razputin, if you could finish this off soon, I might get out of it with only a mild concussion.",""
"SAAG017SA","Sasha","What? Who's there? I think I've lost my vision!",""
"SAAG018SA","Sasha","Why no, Aunt Bernie, of course I didn't get your phone calls or else I would have responded right away. ",""
"SAAG019SA","Sasha","My name is Yan Yanssen, I live in Wisconsin, I work in the lumber yard there...",""
"SAAG020SA","Sasha","La di da... do do da dum...",""
"SAAG021SA","Sasha","Wow. Okay, that last hit brought me back. Where was I?",""
"SAAH000RA","Raz","Um, well, it sure seemed a lot bigger in my head.","Е-е, ну, в моїй голові воно виглядало значно більше."
"SAAH001SA","Sasha","Ah, problems often seem larger in our heads than they really are. That's an important lesson to learn.","А, проблеми часто здаються більшими, ніж вони є насправді. Важливо засвоїти цей урок."
"SAAH002RA","Raz","But--","Але..."
"SAAH003RA","Raz","Yes, but I was attacked in my own head.","Так, але на мене ж напали у моєму власному розумі."
"SAAH004SA","Sasha","Um... Well...",""
"SAAH005SA","Sasha","The machine is having a little trouble. I'm looking into it. Meanwhile...",""
"SAAH006SA","Sasha","As you absorb this energy, your mental health increases. ",""
"SAAH007SA","Sasha","But as you PSI Blast, you expend your will to do damage. ",""
"SAAH008SA","Sasha","So be on the look out for these small, dense clusters of raw psychic aggression.",""
"SAAH009SA","Sasha","Absorb these as well to make sure you always have enough firepower.",""
"SAAH010RA","Raz","Hm. They're coming out faster but still not fast enough.",""
"SAAH011RA","Raz","Hm. Still not fast enough!",""
"SAAH012RA","Raz","Uh oh.",""
"SAAI000SA","Sasha","Good shooting, Raz, but you are making it harder than it needs to be. ",""
"SAAI001SA","Sasha","You need to practice locking your mental focus.",""
"SAAI002SA","Sasha","It makes targeting and evasive maneuvers much easier.",""
"SAAI003SA","Sasha","Let's try again, this time lock your mental focus.",""
"SAAJ000SA","Sasha","Razputin, see those valves? That is where the censors are leaking out.",""
"SAAJ001SA","Sasha","PSI Blast the valves to shut them down and get this area under control!",""
"SAAJ002SA","Sasha","Good, now the next one. You have to get them all.",""
"SAAJ003SA","Sasha","Good, well you got them all. ",""
"SAAJ004SA","Sasha","Oh, no. You close one leak down and another springs up!",""
"SAAJ005SA","Sasha","Well come on. We've got to take care of these too!",""
"SAAK000SA","Sasha","Oh, no. What are you doing back in here?",""
"SAAK001RA","Raz","Practicing.",""
"SAAK002SA","Sasha","Oh, would you like to run the course again?",""
"SAAK003RA","Raz","Yeah, I--run the course? But all that censor overload stuff... that was an accident. ",""
"SAAK004SA","Sasha","Oh, Raz. I knew you were going to overload that switch. I would have done the same thing at your age.",""
"SAAK005SA","Sasha","It was all arranged to make you an expert fighter. And it worked.",""
"SAAK006SA","Sasha","Now, if you'd like to run the course again, just shoot the controller on any given face.",""
"SAAK007SA","Sasha","To close that face up and open another, shoot any censor valves you see.",""
"SAAK008SA","Sasha","Fair enough?",""
"SAAK009RA","Raz","Even the part where the giant censor had you on the stamp?",""
"SAAK010SA","Sasha","Okay, that part got a little out of hand. We won't be seeing him again.",""
"SAAK011SA","Sasha","Razputin! I'm so glad to see you. What's happened?",""
"SAAK012RA","Raz","Coach Oleander is trying to take over the world with a fleet of psychic death tanks, armed with the stolen brains of my fellow campers.",""
"SAAK013RA","Raz","Where are you?",""
"SAAK014SA","Sasha","I... I have no idea. I seem to be... asleep... or in a trance...",""
"SAAK015RA","Raz","Well don't worry about it. Ford and I are on the case.",""
"SAAK016SA","Sasha","Okay. I'd love to join you, but I think I need to focus on maintaining some level of brain activity.",""
"SAAK017RA","Raz","Ooh, I can help with that! Let me shoot up the place!",""
"SAZE000TO","System","Move RIGHT {Joystick} while holding {LeftFlipper} to switch targets.",""
"SAZE001TO","System","Press {RightFlipper} to shoot.",""
"SAZE002TO","System","Hold {LeftFlipper} to lock on to a target.",""
"SAZE003TO","System","Hold {LeftFlipper} to lock on, then press {RightFlipper}",""
"SAZF000TO","System","When your MENTAL FOCUS is LOCKED, press {AButton} and move the LEFT {Joystick} to execute a fast tumble in any direction. Very useful for circling your enemies!",""
"SAZF001TO","System","DAILY MAXIMUM REACHED for this Censor output setting. Please increase Censor output setting if more Censors are desired.",""
"SAAM000SA","Sasha","Enough horseplay, Razputin!",""
"SAAK018SA","Sasha","Razputin, instead of that why don't you help me free Ms. Zanotto?",""
