"GLAJ010FO","Ford","Let's find a way into that asylum!",""

"GLAK000FO","Ford","Why don't you just do what Sasha said. Listen to your teacher, young man!",""
"GLAK001FO","Ford","Well, you might get your merit badge a little faster if you turn up the censor output all the way...",""
"GLAK002FO","Ford","You gotta find all those leaks that are squirting out censors, and take 'em out!",""
"GLAK003FO","Ford","And when you're fighting these guys, don't forget to lock your mental focus on them for accuracy.",""
"GLAK004FO","Ford","Those little censors seem to be restoring the big guy's health. ",""
"GLAK005FO","Ford","You gotta shut down the leaks the little censors are coming out of!",""
"GLAK006FO","Ford","Take the big guy out! ",""
"GLAK007FO","Ford","Don't forget to hold mental focus while you're blasting!",""
"GLAK008FO","Ford","Locking focus on him will also make it easier to circle around and get behind him!",""

"GLAL001FO","Ford","Stay on your bubble, Raz.",""
"GLAL002FO","Ford","Keep trying to get higher, and if you see any of those big rings, keep 'em spinning.",""

"GLAL006FO","Ford","Get those rings spinning!",""
"GLAM000FO","Ford","Let's check out what's inside that caravan. Don't be afraid of your past.",""
"GLAM001FO","Ford","Hey, you heard the man. Follow the bunny.",""
"GLAM002FO","Ford","Keep after that bunny!",""
"GLAM003FO","Ford","Watch out for those killer plants. You can't hurt them when they're all coiled up.",""
"GLAM004FO","Ford","Stay on the ground if you want to fight, but you could probably avoid some of it if you took the higher route. ",""
"GLAM005FO","Ford","We gotta get up to the top of that vine tower!",""
"GLAM006FO","Ford","You can hide behind those pillars to break his target-locking on you.",""
"GLAM007FO","Ford","Wait until he rears up to charge, and then blast him in his soft pink underbelly! Ha!",""
"GLAM008FO","Ford","And then when he's upside down, get him!",""
"GLAM009FO","Ford","Get as high as you can, and float in shooting!",""
"GLAN000FO","Ford","Well, if I were a monster, 50 stories high, I'd probably start smashing stuff.",""
"GLAN001FO","Ford","You heard 'em. Bust open that prison over there.",""
"GLAN002FO","Ford","The Coach is obviously controlling the Lungfish's mind, so he must have planted something in here to amplify his thoughts and subjugate the populace.",""
"GLAN003RA","Raz","Diabolical!",""
"GLAN004FO","Ford","It's probably the enormous communications tower on that distant island.",""
"GLAN005FO","Ford","Smash your way through town and take down that tower.",""
"GLAN006FO","Ford","Your PSI Shield would protect you in that tunnel, and maybe even do some damage to the emitters.",""
"GLAN007FO","Ford","We have to find someone to pilot this blimp for us so we can get over this dam!",""
"GLAN008FO","Ford","Get up on top of these buildings and take out those planes!",""
"GLAN009FO","Ford","You can use those super tankers to get across the channel.",""
"GLAN010FO","Ford","If you pay attention to this guy's actions, you can tell how he's about to attack.",""
"GLAN011FO","Ford","Wait for him to let down his shield, and then attack.",""
"GLAN012FO","Ford","And don't forget to use your own shield!",""
"GLAN013FO","Ford","Okay, now get up that tower and take out the communications equipment at the top!",""
"GLAN014FO","Ford","And why don't you just pick up those pesky tanks and throw them at each other?",""
"GLAO000FO","Ford","Open the fridge! Like he said!",""
"GLAO001FO","Ford","Use your Clairvoyance power on that loony. I'd like to see what color the sky is in his world.",""
"GLAO002FO","Ford","Let's go to the graveyard!",""
"GLAO003FO","Ford","That is the worst road crew disguise I have ever seen.",""
"GLAO004FO","Ford","But if it works for them, it should work for us. We just gotta hold up one of those signs.",""
"GLAO005FO","Ford","Hmmm. Looks like we'll need some flowers as a disguise.",""
"GLAO006FO","Ford","To the Arboretum!",""
"GLAO007RA","Raz","The what?",""
"GLAO008FO","Ford","The plant place. It's like a garden, but more shrubby and scientific.",""
"GLAO009FO","Ford","Let's search this place for flowers.",""
"GLAO010FO","Ford","If you used Clairvoyance on the that crow feather, you might get a birds-eye view of the situation.",""
"GLAO011FO","Ford","You could probably burn those big vines off that mausoleum.",""
"GLAO012FO","Ford","Let's get inside that mausoleum!",""
"GLAO013FO","Ford","We have to find a way through the sewers to the Book Depository.",""
"GLAO014FO","Ford","I'll bet if we could see what that G-Man sees, we would know the right combination.",""
"GLAO015FO","Ford","I forgot the combo. If you forgot it too, we're going to have to make that G-Man come out again.",""
"GLAO016FO","Ford","I can't see a thing.",""
"GLAO017FO","Ford","Try your Clairvoyance on those security cameras. I'll bet they can see in the dark.",""
"GLAO018FO","Ford","Looks like they got a sniper. If you time it right, your shield should get you through there.",""
"GLAO019FO","Ford","Use your Clairvoyance on one of those helicopters and we'll be able to search for the Milkman from the air.",""
"GLAO020FO","Ford","That telephone would be a good disguise for getting up to those phone company wires.",""
"GLAO021FO","Ford","Ever play doorbell ditch?",""
"GLAO022FO","Ford","Let's make sure we're out of sight before she makes it to the door. ",""

"GLAP000FO","Ford","Let's go back to the dressing rooms and see if we can't get this Bonita person to take the stage.",""
"GLAP001FO","Ford","Somewhere in that storage room is a candle that we need.",""

"GLAP003FO","Ford","Well, I think you should go talk to that blowhard up in the balcony and give him a piece of your mind.",""
"GLAP004FO","Ford","...and see if he knows anything.",""
"GLAP005FO","Ford","Let's give this script to Becky and see if it's any good.",""
"GLAP006FO","Ford","I wonder if those prop doors on the set really work?",""
"GLAP007FO","Ford","I'll bet if you punched that strange spotlight with the faces on it, you could change what's going on on stage.",""
"GLAP008FO","Ford","We have to get up to the catwalks and get rid of that Phantom character.",""
"GLAP009FO","Ford","I'll bet the right script played on the right set would do it!",""
"GLAP010FO","Ford","Let's take that prop magic cloud elevator thing up to the catwalks.",""
"GLAP011FO","Ford","Those spotlights couldn't find you if you were invisible.",""
"GLAP012FO","Ford","Let's turn a light on this guy so we can see who he is.",""
"GLAP013FO","Ford","Let's float up to the catwalks and blind him with those spotlights so he'll let down his guard.",""
"GLAP014FO","Ford","Zig zag on the way up to avoid the fat man's attacks.",""
"GLAQ000FO","Ford","Well, we'll never get our troops over that river while the bridge is out.",""

"GLAQ008FO","Ford","We gotta go through that building over there and find that guy's Musket!",""
"GLAQ009FO","Ford","Okay, we just gotta get that drawbridge down, and get a Hearty Knight to storm Napoleon's stronghold and we'll win.",""
"GLAQ010FO","Ford","We gotta get some fancy food for that fat guy to eat.",""
"GLAQ011RA","Raz","You didn't even see him. How do you know he's fat?",""
"GLAQ012FO","Ford","He sounds fat.",""
"GLAQ013FO","Ford","Why don't you TK a pail on top of em? That will slow 'em down.",""
"GLAQ014FO","Ford","We're going to have to infiltrate the grounds of the stronghold and see if we can't get the drawbridge down for fatty. ",""
"GLAR000FO","Ford","Buy all the paintings you can, and look for hooks to hang them on.",""

"GLAR004FO","Ford","Throw a confusion grenade at that Bull. That should buy you some time.",""

"GLAR006FO","Ford","Man, get those spears out of Edgar's back! What kind of friend are you?",""
"GLAR007FO","Ford","And see if you can confuse that Matador.",""
"GLAR008FO","Ford","While that Matador thinks he's a bull, he's probably vulnerable like a bull.",""
